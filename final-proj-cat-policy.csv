It was yet another broken populist campaign promise, joining ""great health care,"" putting coal miners back to work, a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan and more. Trump has kept his promise to crack down on immigrants, but the economic populism has proved to be a mirage. 
Of course that doesn't mean he won't try to fool people into thinking otherwise: ""Everyone involved in the broken system - the drugmakers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and many others - contribute to the problem,"" Trump said. ""Government has also been part of the problem because previous leaders turned a blind eye to this incredible abuse.""

All of that is true, but the one key to dealing with the problem is to recognize that everything stems from the upfront price that drugmakers charge and there's no way to keep them honest.

And that's not just a problem for the advocates, it's a problem for those they purport to represent.”Democrats to Moulton's left have offered very different assessments of where they think their party went wrong and what they see as the path forward.US Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose presidential campaign was famously built on her “having a plan for everything,” published a “plan to fight back” in Time Magazine on Thursday.While Harris “deserves credit for running an inspiring campaign under unprecedented circumstances,” Warren wrote, she urged Democrats to “unrig the economy” to win back working-class voters.She called on Democrats to step up oversight efforts in Congress, fight Trump in the courts, get involved at the grassroots level, and, most pressingly, for the Senate to use the remaining time before the new Congress takes office to confirm federal judges and key regulators while they still have power.Her assessment was similar to, though less scathing than, one offered by progressive Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sanders, who has drawn criticism in recent days for bashing party leadership, wrote in a Globe op-ed on Sunday that “Democrats lost this election because they ignored the justified anger of working-class America and became the defenders of a rigged economic and political system.”The two New England senators' takes on the election, which align neatly with their personal policy preferences, show how legislators have retreated to their party factions as they assign blame for Democrats' overwhelming losses.Representative Jake Auchincloss, another moderate Democrat in the state's congressional delegation, told the Globe on Monday that in his district — where one of the biggest cities, Fall River, voted for a Republican for the first time in a century — there was “a sense that Democrats are not working for them.”Asked about Moulton's assessment of where Democrats were missing the mark, Auchincloss declined to directly address his colleague's take.”We certainly need to be able to have hard conversations as a party,” he said. “I'm actually less worried, though, about where Democrats are debating things, and I'm more worried about where they seem to be in strong agreement.”He pushed back on what he saw as Democrats looking to “dial up economic populism” and cautioned against “trying to backpedal into a MAGA-lite party.” The party, he said, needs to put forth a more “authentic agenda,” which would include items such as balancing the budget, securing the southern border, and building more affordable housing.Those in the LGTBQ+ community said in the end, by singling out the transgender community, whatever his motives, Moulton played into the GOP agenda, rather than effectively critiquing the Democratic one.“You have joined [the Trump agenda],” Giselle Byrd, a trans advocate and executive director of Boston's The Theater Offensive said of Moulton. “Congressman Moulton's comments are not only riddled with transphobia, but they send a message of fear-mongering throughout this country in a time where we are already experiencing that.”Matt Stout and Anjali Huynh of the Globe staff contributed to this report.",Newspapers,2024,"person, policy, group, ideology",[]

Trump's announcement on Thursday that he would press forward with a 25-per-cent tariff on steel imports and 10 per cent on aluminum left markets reeling and was a public rebuke of Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, who had furiously lobbied against the penalties. One person with knowledge of the chaotic West Wing decisionmaking process said Cohn and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who had recommended the tariffs to the president, privately argued over the issue just hours before it was announced. The tariffs appeared to mark the tipping point for Cohn, 57, a registered Democrat who made clear that he saw his job in the administration to be an advocate for business-friendly economic principles. He helped Trump steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. His departure may cause further turmoil in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an unpredictable administration, and leaves uncertainty about Trump's economic agenda. Trump expressed gratitude to Cohn in a written statement: ""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.""

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

Many of those businesses use steel in their products, or sell their goods to other countries that might retaliate if the tariffs spark a  trade war. ""Since these manufacturing companies are such a large share of income and jobs in Indiana, it is likely that the Indiana economy would suffer from the tariffs even though we do produce aluminum and steel,"" said Wally Tyner, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University. That dichotomy helps explains why, in a state Trump won by 19 percentage points on an economic populist message, public officials are so divided over his policy.

However, Democrats are betting if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, he'll drive moderate suburban swing voters, and possibly some Republican women, into Clinton's column.

""They may not need to move too far to the center because many of these suburban swing voters are so repelled by Trump,"" said Larry Jacobs, a presidential politics scholar at the University of Minnesota. The Clinton campaign also believes economic populism is now mainstream in both parties. It held back a middle-class tax cut plan during the primary, believing that rolling it out in the general election will energize  both moderates and progressives. While her tax measures thus far have focused on specific tax credits, the campaign is now aiming to deliver a broader middle-class tax relief plan with a specific dollar amount, according to one aide.

Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster at Lake Research Partners, said that Democratic elites such as lawmakers, think-tank leaders and consultants have been alarmed by Trump's economic populism.

He portrayed the push for gun control as freedom to be safe and the expansion of ballot access for minorities as freedom to vote.These issues enjoy broad support from Biden's base and beyond. Seeking to reclaim the mantle of economic populism from Trump, Biden laid out a progressive vision of his social welfare agenda by proposing to reshape the corporate tax system to make the wealthiest Americans pay more.By promising to protect American freedom and democracy, Biden is tapping into public dissatisfaction with the way democracy is working in the country; approval is at a historic low of 28%.However, while linking protection of freedom and democracy at home and abroad was a clever rhetorical device for a speech, it's unclear how effective it will be to motivate voters in November, Chris Tuttle, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA.Pro-Palestinian groups in Biden's base point out that his handling of Gaza is an example of hypocrisy in his argument for freedom.In his speech, Biden quoted Ronald Reagan, who asked Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall"" that encircled what was then West Berlin, said Hassan Abdel Salam, representative of the Abandon Biden campaign led by disenchanted former supporters of the president.He stayed silent when all we wanted from him was to call on the Israeli government to finally 'tear down this wall' that enables death, destruction and famine upon an innocent people, Salam told VOA.A more balanced approach on GazaAs casualties mount, Biden has been increasingly candid toward Israel, delivering a rare rebuke that humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip.In addition to ordering the U.S. military to airdrop aid, he has directed it to establish a temporary pier off Gaza's shore to facilitate aid shipments from Cyprus, an extraordinary and expensive operation.The president is signaling growing frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the humanitarian crisis and unwillingness to work toward a two-state solution, William F. Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs, told VOA.Biden's campaign is betting that with a more balanced approach, Democrats outraged by the president's policies on Gaza will decide on Election Day that the alternative would be worse.

After all, Trump promised to cut taxes, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, provide health insurance to all Americans and pay off the national debt, and he paid no price for the obvious inconsistency of these promises.Hey, arithmetic has a well-known liberal bias -- and the commitment of the mainstream media to ""balance"" virtually guarantees enough false equivalence to obscure even the most obvious fraud.On the other hand, the ignominious failure of Trumpcare shows that reality sometimes does matter.True, Republicans long paid no price for lying about Obamacare; in fact, those lies helped them take control of Congress. But when they gained control of the White House, too, so that the prospect of repealing the Affordable Care Act became real, the lies caught up with them.Once the public realized that tens of millions would lose coverage under Republican plans, there was a huge backlash; that backlash may give Democrats the House next year, despite all the gerrymandering and other structural disadvantages they face.The story of tax reform -- actually, given the likely content of whatever legislative proposal may finally emerge, we should call it tax ""reform"" -- is starting to look a bit similar. During the campaign Trump could get away with posing as an economic populist while offering a tax plan that would add $6 trillion to the deficit, with half the benefit going to the richest 1 percent of the population. But this kind of bait-and-switch may not work once an actual bill is on the table.In fact, Trump himself seems to be experiencing cognitive dissonance.

Like his claims that Trumpcare wouldn't cause anyone to lose coverage, this statement raises questions about what's going on in his mind: Is he oblivious, lying, or both?But in any case, such statements are going to make it even harder to pass anything: The contrast between what he's claiming and anything Republicans in Congress will be willing to support is so great as to practically invite ridicule and another popular backlash.I'd add that tax cuts for corporations and the rich have little popular support.",Newspapers,2017,"person, policy, ideology","['tax cuts', 'protecting Social Security', 'protecting Medicare', 'healthcare reform']"

One boatload is the corporate and individual tax cut, of which America’s richest 1 percent will take home an estimated 82 percent by 2027, according to the Tax Policy Center. Another boatload is coming from government itself, which Trump has filled with lobbyists who are letting large corporations do whatever they want — using public lands, polluting, defrauding consumers and investors, even employing children — in order to push profits even higher. Trump’s red meat for the white working class is initiatives and tirades against unauthorized immigrants and foreign traders — as if they’re responsible for the working class’s lost ground — and other symbolic gestures of economic populism, along with episodic racist outbursts, and support for guns and evangelicals. Every time Trump sends more money to the wealthy, he sends more red meat to his base. Weeks ago, after announcing he’d seek another big tax cut before the midterm elections — “phase two,” as he termed it — he threatened China with a trade war; arranged another crackdown on unauthorized immigrants, including a carefully choreographed plan to break up families at the border and attack sanctuary cities; and vowed to go after pharmaceutical companies.

Several new studies illustrate how.,6/4/2019,WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post,"President Trump's tariffs and trade wars play a critical role in his reelection schema. Having largely thrown in with conventional GOP plutocracy — most notably with the massive 2017 corporate tax cuts — Trump's moves on trade are the political life support that keeps alive the faint-pulsed aura of economic populism he concocted in 2016, largely betrayed in office, and hopes to duplicate in 2020. So it could not be more fitting that two new studies are now showing that Trump's trade policies could wipe out the gains that Trump's tax cut delivered to the non-wealthy — gains that were meager to begin with, relatively speaking, and could now disappear entirely. The overlapping of these two stories — the damage caused by Trump's trade wars bleeding into an undermining of the tax cut's minuscule low-end benefits — provides a new occasion to revisit the failures and fraudulence of the superstructure of policies and priorities often described as ""Trumpism.""
The new studies come to us courtesy of Jim Tankersley of the New York Times, who reports that both the Tax Foundation and the Penn Wharton Budget Model have concluded that Trump's tariffs amount to a significant tax increase, by raising consumer goods. As Tankersley reports, if Trump goes forward with his planned tariffs on Mexico, along with the other ones he has threatened toward China and on automobiles, the studies conclude that it ""would wipe out all or most of the benefits his 2017 tax cuts delivered to low- and middle-income Americans."" Here's the Tax Foundation's conclusion:

Accounting for both the tax cuts and the full range of tariffs, the Tax Foundation estimates, the lowest-earning fifth of American taxpayers would see an effective tax increase of 1.1 percent of their income this year.",Web Resources,2019,"person, policy","['trade protectionism', 'corporate tax cuts']"

In a more than 90-minute speech that meandered through lengthy digressions about the negotiations to purchase a new Air Force One and his personal voting experience in Florida, President Trump spoke on Sunday before a tightly packed crowd outside an airport hangar in New Hampshire, calling Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s set of economic proposals a “missile aimed at the heart of the middle class.” 
The president focused in particular on the Biden campaign’s tax platform, painting it as a pledge to raise taxes. (Mr. Biden has said his tax plan calls for increases only on those making more than $400,000 a year.) Mr. Trump aired a new video about an hour into his rally, using clips of past statements by Mr. Biden that proclaimed, “Joe Biden has a tax problem.”
Mr. Biden has been maintaining his own relentless attack on Mr. Trump’s economic platform, framing it as a race between “Park Avenue vs. Scranton.” The former vice president has embraced some economic populist messages as he makes a similar pitch for the middle class with promises to create jobs, especially in his response to the coronavirus. 
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly declared that “we’re rounding the turn” on the coronavirus in his speech on Sunday, just hours after his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told CNN that “we are not going to control the virus” and as an outbreak spread among the staff of Vice President Mike Pence. 
On Friday, more than 85,000 new cases of the virus were reported across the country, a single-day record.

Donohue said government regulation of banks has gone too far in response to the financial crisis, citing ""the absolute frustration of running a bank or a financial institution and having half a dozen regulators in your building telling you what you're supposed to do every day.""


Lawmakers should be open to technical and clarifying changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, he said, calling the law a ""tome"" that was ""written in anger and it was written in a hurry.""


Bruce Josten, the Chamber's executive vice president for government affairs, said, ""Something's awry in this whole process of how we're racing to regulate,"" without considering how parts of the law might be poorly written or executed. 

Liberal Democrats, including Warren, have pushed back against such changes to Dodd-Frank, warning that the strategy of bank lobbyists is to chip away at the bill through smaller technical changes and bigger changes attached to must-pass bills. President Obama signed larger bills including small but significant changes to the law in December and January, worrying some advocates of tight bank regulations. 

Donohue issued a forceful warning against economic populism and defense of business in his speech Wednesday morning, delivered at the Chamber's Washington headquarters across from the White House. 

""Contrary to what some of our political leaders have said, businesses really do create the jobs. They really do build things,"" Donohue told the audience of hundreds. ""Whether they reside on Main Street or even on Wall Street, businesses are not the enemy.""

Unlike neoliberalism, productivism gives governments and civil society an important role in achieving that goal. It places less faith in markets, is suspicious of large corporations and emphasizes production and investment over finance, and the revitalization of local communities over globalization.Productivism also departs from the Keynesian welfare state by focusing less on redistribution, social transfers and macroeconomic management and more on supply-side measures to create good jobs for all. And productivism differs from its two antecedents by reflecting greater skepticism toward technocrats and expressing less instinctive hostility toward economic populism.The rhetoric of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, and some of its policies, feature many of these elements. Examples include adopting industrial policies to ease the green transition, rebuild domestic supply chains, and stimulate good jobs; blaming big corporate profits as the culprit for inflation; and refusing (so far) to repeal former President Donald Trump's tariffs against China.

3094841864,Democrats warned to keep euphoria in check as election remains on knife-edge,8/20/2024,Guardian News & Media Limited,"Anxious Democratic strategists are quietly trying to douse the euphoria engulfing Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign by warning that her surge in popularity masks an election contest that is on a knife-edge and could easily be lost.As the vice-president basks in adulation and optimism at the Democratic national convention in Chicago, key supporters are cautioning that more trying times lie ahead after an extended honeymoon period following her ascent to the top of the ticket in place of Joe Biden.Fuelling the Democrats’ feelgood mood have been a spate of opinion polls showing Harris with a national lead over Donald Trump while also leading or newly competitive in battleground states, including southern Sun belt states where Biden had been struggling badly before his withdrawal from the race last month.A recent compilation of national polls by 538, a polling website, showed Harris leading Trump by 46.6% to 43.8%.But Chauncey McLean, the president of Super Forward, a pro-Harris Super Pac that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Harris’s campaign, suggested that the poll figures concealed sobering realities.“Our numbers are much less rosy than what you’re seeing in public,” he told an event hosted by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics on the convention’s opening day on Monday.He described Pennsylvania, which he identified as the most critical of seven battleground states, as a “coin flip” between Harris and Trump.And despite the apparent resurrection in the Democrats’ prospects, the race overall remains as close as ever.“We have it tight as a tick, and pretty much across the board,” Reuters quoted McLean as saying. To win, he said, Harris must capture one of three states – Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Georgia. Recent surveys in the first two have recorded her with a narrow lead or neck-and-neck with Trump, while Trump leads by a wider margin in Georgia, a southern state that Biden won narrowly in 2020.McLean said Harris’s momentum stemmed from an early enthusiasm among young voters of colour in the Sun belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona.But she had yet to reassemble the coalition of Black, Hispanic and young voters that underpinned Biden’s victory four years ago. Internal polling shows that voters want more detail on policy.The cautionary theme was amplified by David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama, who told the Guardian this week that the Harris campaign must guard against complacency.“I think that if the Harris campaign has one message it will try to get across during this convention, it’s that there is no room for complacency in this election,” he said.The vice-president has already faced scrutiny over her recent disavowal of liberal policy positions she assumed during her ill-fated campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020, when she publicly opposed fracking and advocated a single-payer health insurance system that would ultimately have ended private health insurance.While subtly trying to stake out differences from Biden’s position on economic policy – a vulnerable area for Democrats – she has so far avoided one-on-one media interviews since being confirmed as the Democratic nominee, an approach that will need to be jettisoned as the campaign proceeds, thereby ushering in the dangers of public misstatements or policy pronouncements that prove unpopular.But in comments to the New York Times, Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, said embracing ideas of economic populism that are controversial because they run counter to the prevailing free-market neoliberal orthodoxy might be necessary to win precisely because they are attractive to Trump supporters.“I think that our coalition is bound to lose if we don’t find a way to reach out to some element of the folks who have been hoodwinked by Donald Trump,” he said. “We don’t have to win over 25% of his voters. We have to win 5 or 10% of his voters.”Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 presidential election campaigns told the Hill that Harris’s campaign needs to weather a storm at some point.“Every presidential campaign in modern history has had to go through an unanticipated scandal, crisis or world event, and at some point, that political law is going to happen to Kamala Harris’s campaign,” he said. “Until she passes that stress test – and I’m confident she will – this election is still wide open.",Web Resources,2024,"person, policy, ideology",['economic populism']

Warren's message Monday night was rooted in economic populism, and  she called for a return to the liberal policies of the mid-20th   century. In those years, she said, ""the 97 percent -- not the top  10 percent -- the heart of America, got 70 percent of the income  growth in this country.""

The beauty of that middle-of-the-road, shared-sacrifice approach for the ruling class is that it locks in the surge in federal spending of the last five years. Americans must pay higher taxes to accommodate government spending that plateaus at 23% to 24% of GDP rather than the previous peacetime norm of 18% to 20%. Mayor Bloomberg states the obvious when he describes President Obama's budget strategy as economic populism that is not serious and the House agreed, rejecting the president's fiscal 2013 budget by a vote of 414 to 0. But Mr. Bloomberg also views conservative plans as ""divorced from reality."" In fact, conservative tax proposals generally produce federal revenues of about 18% of GDP over the next 10 years, right in line with the historical average. If all Bush tax rates are allowed to expire in 2013, as Mayor Bloomberg recommends, the CBO projects federal revenues will climb to about $41 trillion (roughly 21% of GDP, on average).

Overall, the plans represent a continuation of many Biden administration priorities. Harris isn’t looking for any radical departures from President Joe Biden, who stepped down from the race last month and endorsed her. Still, the vice president has embraced a dash of economic populism, shifting away from Biden’s emphasis on job creation and infrastructure to matters more closely tied to easing the cost of living -– food prices, housing costs and tax breaks for families. Much of what she’s proposing would require congressional approval, which is far from assured in the current political environment, though, and Harris’ campaign has offered scant details on how to pay for the ideas. The vice president is seeking to blunt Trump’s attacks on her as “a radical California liberal who broke the economy,” as he put in during a speech Thursday, during which he displayed popular grocery store items meant to represent the high cost of food. Some of Trump’s economic advisers offered further rebuttals to Harris’ plans before she spoke on Friday, with Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the former president’s campaign, calling them representative of a “socialist and authoritarian model.”
Kevin Hassett, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Trump administration, called it “completely preposterous” for the government to play a role in setting food prices, a reference to Harris’ proposed federal ban on “corporate price-gouging” on food.",Newspapers,2024,"person, policy, ideology","['earned income tax credit expansion', 'lower health insurance premiums', 'ban on corporate price-gouging']"

In his speech, Trump is expected to outline his agenda, including a significantly tougher approach to immigration and border security. Signs in the convention hall read, ""mass deportation now!"" He has also called for more domestic energy production, stiffer tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, soon-to-expire tax cuts from his 2017 tax bill being made permanent, and a lowered corporate tax rate of 15% from 21%.

Becoming Catholic for Mr. Vance, who was loosely raised as an evangelical, was a practical way to counter what he saw as elite values, especially secularism. He was drawn not just to the church’s theological ideas, but also to its teachings on family and social order and its desire to instill virtue in modern society. That worldview served as a counterpoint to much of his messy childhood, and meshed with his own criticisms of contemporary America, from what he saw as the abandonment of workers to the unhappiness of “childless cat ladies.” It has also infused his politics, which seeks to advance a family-oriented, socially conservative future through economic populism and by standing with abortion opponents. Converting to Catholicism was joining “the resistance,” he wrote in the Catholic journal. This portrait of Mr. Vance’s Catholic conversion and beliefs is drawn from dozens of his public remarks and writings, and interviews with Catholics in his religious and intellectual circles in Ohio and Washington.

Among them: cabinet members like former Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, Representative Maxine Waters, the political strategist Donna Brazile and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge. Many Americans, especially Black people, remember the spectacle of Mr. Jackson’s presidential ambitions: the massive rallies, the chants of “Run, Jesse, run!” But those campaigns also merged a unique platform of economic populism, social justice and moral urgency.

Pressley, House Democrats were passing a minimum wage bill with scant Republican support and little expectation of Senate passage. On the same day, the president issued a perfunctory announcement naming Eugene Scalia, a corporate lawyer and the son of Antonin Scalia, a former Supreme Court justice, as his new secretary of labor on the recommendation of Senator Tom Cotton, a hard-line Arkansas conservative.The events offered a reminder not only of what Mr. Trump was interested in -- racially driven grabs of news media attention -- but also of what he was not: governing the way he campaigned in 2016 and co-opting elements of the Democrats' populist agenda to drive a wedge through their coalition.Since he became president, Mr. Trump has largely operated as a conventional Republican, cutting taxes that benefit high-end earners and companies, rolling back regulations on corporations and appointing administration officials and judges with deep roots in the conservative movement. His approach has delighted much of the political right.It has also relieved Democrats.""Just imagine if Trump married his brand of cultural populism to economic populism,"" said Representative Brendan F.

The political dynamics in Washington started to change around Christmas, when President Trump shed any pretense of being a true economic populist and handed corporate America the big, fat whopping tax break that it had been waiting for since the start of his presidency. The tax cut was icing on the cake after a year when the administration quietly moved forward with deregulations for the corporate and financial sectors that were issued through executive action.

His canny central insight is that we have never recovered from the ruinous atomization of the Reagan Revolution, which depicted any government at all as ""an alien spaceship descending on the happy residents of Middlesuburb, U.S.A., sucking up into itself all the resources, corrupting the children, and enslaving the population."" He notes, for example, that it was Bill Clinton who declared that ""the era of big government is over"" in 1996. Yes, I know he was ""triangulating."" But he was abdicating too. But if Democratic politicians have largely abandoned New Deal policies, it is because their liberal base had by the 1980s lost interest in the kind of economic populism that had once been the party's central creed. In the hands of the post-Vietnam left, Lilla argues, the individualism of the right became identity politics, an obsession with race, ethnicity and gender that blinded Democrats to unifying realities: ""Reaganism for lefties.""
Some of what follows seems to borrow from conservative critiques of liberalism, which I suspect is why Lilla's New York Times op-ed piece attracted so much ire. The noble convictions of the civil rights movement, Stonewall and feminism, Lilla says, have devolved into an obsession with selfhood, in the ways we are different, not the same.

By positioning tariffs as a cornerstone of the GOP platform, Trump has challenged the free-market orthodoxy that has dominated the party for decades. He has called on Republicans in Congress to support the tariff agenda and align themselves with the MAGA vision for America. In doing so, Trump has framed tariffs not just as a policy choice, but as a litmus test for Republicans who claim to prioritize American interests.The economic populism behind Trumps tariff policies has exposed a rift within the GOP, with some members embracing the protectionist stance and others clinging to traditional free-market principles. This divide represents a fundamental question for the future of the party: should the GOP prioritize the economic wellbeing of American workers over the ideological commitment to free trade? For Trump and his supporters, the answer is clear: the time has come for the Republican Party to embrace tariffs and reject the globalist economic model that has undermined American prosperity.The debate over tariffs is more than a clash over trade policy; it is a battle over the future of American economic sovereignty.

Sinema may remain a problem, but she has never been forced to publicly own her opposition to these very popular policies, which even Manchin supports. Taken together, this approach is not just a way to make the best of a tough situation, but a path to rounding out two years that will, if something like Manchin's proposal passes, have been very successful legislatively for Biden.

""They may not need to move too far to the center because many of these suburban swing voters are so repelled by Trump,"" said Larry Jacobs, a presidential politics scholar at the University of Minnesota. The Clinton campaign also believes economic populism is now mainstream in both parties. It held back a middle-class tax cut plan during the primary, believing that rolling it out in the general election will energize  both moderates and progressives. While her tax measures thus far have focused on specific tax credits, the campaign is now aiming to deliver a broader middle-class tax relief plan with a specific dollar amount, according to one aide.

And it would offer that check without jeopardizing any potential conservative legislative achievements — because, let’s be frank, the congressional G.O.P. isn’t going to do anything serious with its power if it gets re-elected except confirm judges, and you don’t need the House to elevate Amy Coney Barrett if there’s one more high court vacancy. At the same time, for the genuinely populist sort for conservative (that is, the best kind), having a Democratic House might force Trump himself back toward the economic populism of his campaign, which he mostly abandoned but has suddenly remembered in the last days before the midterms, talking up a phantom middle-class tax cut and proposing an “America First” approach to drug pricing. So giving up the House restrains and redirects Trump at relatively little cost, and perhaps even some policy advantage. Keeping the Senate Republican in this cycle, on the other hand, doesn’t just allow for more conservative judicial nominations.

At the core of Brown's message is a simple idea: The way to confer dignity on work is to ensure that it pays well. Due to structural economic factors beyond ordinary Americans' control, wages have stagnated for millions, with many trapped in the ranks of the working poor; but government can remedy this through the tax code by sending struggling Americans money. Many progressive economists and Democratic lawmakers are coalescing around a way to do this, through one version or another of expanded tax credits for working people and families, to supplement their income and lift them out of poverty and/or closer to the ranks of the middle-class.",Web Resources,2019,"person, policy, ideology",['tax credits for working families']

The tariffs appeared to mark the tipping point for Cohn, 57, a registered Democrat who made clear that he saw his job in the administration to be an advocate for business-friendly economic principles. He helped Trump steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon.

There are strategists in Biden’s coalition who hope to do considerably more than that, either by maneuvering the Democratic Party more decisively toward the political center or by competing more assertively with Republicans on themes of economic populism (or perhaps through some combination of the two).

By Daniel Lippman 

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein announced her vice presidential choice on Wednesday, naming Cheri Honkala, an anti-poverty advocate from Philadelphia and national coordinator for the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign. 

""My running mate has been on the front lines fighting for the American poor, taking on the banks, taking on foreclosures, standing up for children most at risk,"" Ms. Stein said. 

Ms. Stein also said that her party, running heavily on environmental and economic populist themes, would compete nationally and take their message to the American people. 

At an event at the National Press Club in Washington, Ms. Stein laid out her campaign platform, heavily emphasizing what she called ""the Green New Deal"" of economic justice and jobs for all Americans who want them, tough financial regulation, political reform to reduce the role of money in politics, and a transition to a ""green"" economy. 

Ms. Stein and her campaign manager, Ben Manski, said the Green Party will be on the presidential ballot in more than 40 states and this week filed for matching funds from the Federal Election Commission.

Populism
Raul Reyes noted that ""Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.""
The 80-year-old president's vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild America's manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world. But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, ""times have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return.""
""Biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s.""
Biden's success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. ""By keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the 'soul of the nation.' Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not.""

America’s deteriorating infrastructure not only costs taxpayers billions of dollars through the constant cost of maintenance and replacement, but also puts millions of innocent lives at risk. President Trump’s repeated insistence on infrastructure reform is relatively unorthodox for a Republican president, drawing the ire of more fiscally-conservative hardliners who are likely to balk at the cost of such a major proposal. Consequently, this provides the President with a chance to return the economically populist roots of his 2016 campaign (an essential move if he intends to win re-election) and gifts the Democrats with an opportunity to prove their willingness to approach bipartisan compromise on a major issue. Additionally, a national infrastructure project would likely aid in bridging the increasingly-apparent divide among urban and rural Americans. Crumbling transit systems have deeply harmed both communities, and pursuing new measures would present a rare opportunity to address their concerns together.

She stressed tax breaks for families, as well as middle- and lower-income people, promising to expand the child tax credit to up to $3,600 - and $6,000 for children in their first year of life. The vice president also wants to enlarge the earned income tax credit to cover people in lower-income jobs without children - which the campaign estimates would cut their effective tax rate by $1,500 - and lower health insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act. Harris isn't looking for any radical departures from President Joe Biden, who stepped down from the race last month and endorsed her. Still, the vice president has embraced a dash of economic populism, shifting away from Biden's emphasis on job creation and infrastructure to matters more closely tied to easing the cost of living; food prices, housing costs and tax breaks for families. Much of what she's proposing would require congressional approval, which is far from assured in the current political environment, though, and Harris' campaign has offered scant details on how to pay for the ideas. The vice president is seeking to blunt Trump's attacks on her. He responded to her speech by posting on his social media account, ""Kamala will implement SOVIET style price controls.""

For those who see the Democratic Party in turmoil, poised to lose its razor-thin congressional majority in November, and then the White House in 2024, Michael Tomasky has a message for you: Calm down. The party is back in good hands, moving cautiously to the left, where Tomasky, the liberal editor of The New Republic, insists it belongs. Democrats are most successful, he believes, when they focus on the economy and the ways in which big government can make the lives of ordinary Americans fairer and more secure. It’s been a winning formula since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, he writes in “The Middle Out,” an engaging, briskly paced mix of partisanship and history, and it has found a new champion in a president not previously known for his economic populism. The story begins with F.D.R., the godfather of modern liberalism, whose New Deal programs provided a vital safety net for the hungry and unemployed without actually ending the Great Depression. World War II did that by creating millions of high-paying but potentially short-term jobs in the defense industries.

The Monica Lewinsky scandal put a damper on the bid to reclaim family values for Democrats over the short run, and the fallout from the administration's policies over the long run was even worse: Free trade hollowed out the heartland, lax financial regulations helped inflate bubbles on Wall Street and Democrats failed to stem organized labor's ongoing decline.The stage was set for a revolt when the economy turned south, which it did just in time for outrage with the agonizingly slow recovery to be directed at the country's first Black president.

But they are much more likely to support actual spending for families -- a full child tax credit to every family with a worker present, assistance in paying for child care, social spending on pregnant mothers and elimination of tax code provisions and safety net policies that are more generous to couples who live together than those who marry. And as the parties increasingly sort along educational lines, parents without college degrees are the engine of today's Republican Party.A pro-family agenda coupled with cultural and economic populism also has appeal to liberals. For example, over 80 percent of Republican and Democratic parents agreed that it is both ""too easy for kids to find explicit content online"" and that tech companies should be required to obtain parents' permission before allowing minors to create a social media account.The research suggests an agenda that seeks to make it easier for couples to marry would garner support from most parents, not just conservatives.

""They work in the oilfields and they hear they are racist, and they just got tired of it being slammed in their face.""He added, ""Tell your editors that they need to run a headline that says 'Main Street Won.'""And yet, in the weeks since Trump's surprise election, Wall Street has been winning, too.The stocks of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years - a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise.The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo's share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in September.For now, banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the president-elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the industry, including the fees banks can charge, whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold.Banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a Trump administration's fiscal stimulus program revives inflation. Higher rates would increase the value of some of the banks' holdings and would widen banks' margins on loans.But like nearly all of Trump's policy positions, his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail.Trump's feelings on banks, perhaps more so than other industries, are difficult to sort out.On one hand, he has called for dismantling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits. On the other, he has railed against Wall Street elites for keeping down small-town America.How, then, will Trump justify policies that bolster bank profits, while also delivering on his promises of economic populism?Community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot. They say Trump can limit regulations - particularly on banks with less than $10 billion in assets - while still being tough on the Wall Street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public.Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural America Trump championed in his campaign.Among community bankers, support for Trump has been pervasive and consistent.Roughly 84 per cent of community bankers supported Trump, according to a poll that the industry's trade group conducted after the political conventions this summer.""I didn't have any Trump signs in my yard,"" said Tim Zimmerman, president of Standard Bank, which operates in communities outside Pittsburgh. ""But I want the bank to do well and to be able to help people in the community.

The State of the Union speech then was in keeping with the rhetoric coming out of this president and this White House dating back to the payroll tax cut extension fight late last year. 

It seems as though the debt-ceiling fight, which Obama described as a ""fiasco"" in his address tonight, convinced him once and for all that the only way to effectively deal with Republicans was show them that he was willing to talk tougher and push harder than they were. 

Glenn Thrush at Politico says Mr. Obama's speech demonstrated that he is staking his re-election on an economic populist message more raw than anything he campaigned on four years ago. 

At the Daily Beast Peter Beinhart writes that Mr. Obama ""blew"" the opportunity to trumpet the vital role of American government in making capitalism work. 

At Salon.com, Steve Kornacki says that Mr. Obama's remarks demonstrated that ""he's intent on pursuing a far more combative and populist path to a second term."" 

Obama offered a forceful and comprehensive rebuttal to the class warfare charge, one we'll surely be hearing again and again these next nine months. He made a case for letting the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy expire and for imposing the ""Buffet rule"" -- doing away with tax rules that allow millionaires who make their money from investments to pay an income tax rate that's lower than the one paid by people who earn a fraction of their income.",Newspapers,2012,"person, policy, ideology","['tax increases on wealthy', 'Buffett rule']"

For Biden, that begins with the pandemic relief plan, a package that includes a $1,400 check for most adults, increased unemployment insurance, a child tax credit of up to $3,600 a year, $440 billion for state and local governments and $130 billion to help reopen schools. And once that proposal is enacted, White House officials say, the president will turn to the broader, long-term economic proposals of his campaign, including a $400-billion ""Buy American"" plan to support manufacturing, $300 billion for research and development, more spending on clean energy and -- if it doesn't pass as part of the pandemic package -- a $15 minimum wage. It's an ambitious agenda: a dramatic expansion of federal government spending to create jobs, especially in manufacturing and strategic technologies. Biden's economic populism is aimed, in part, at the same voters Donald Trump appealed to when he called for revitalizing American manufacturing and bringing jobs back home -- but only in the sense that Biden, too, has promised to repair some of the damage wrought by the long decline in manufacturing jobs.

And that economic populism could provide new momentum in Washington behind policies adverse to the interests of big companies, for better or for worse.

Hillary!” and “I believe she will win.”The positive mood has traveled with Clinton in her final stretch across Iowa, the state that on Monday begins the first nominating contest of the 2016 race. Although Clinton remains locked in a competitive battle with Sanders, she holds a slight advantage: 45% to 42% in Saturday’s final Des Moines Register poll.In combating Sanders and his grassroots movement, Clinton has focused her message on the need to build upon and expand the legacies of the last two Democratic presidents: her husband and Barack Obama. Introducing her, Bill Clinton struck similar themes.“She’s a world-class change-maker,” he said, adding that a president must be capable of finding common ground without sacrificing core principles.“Of all of the people I have ever worked with in my public life, Hillary is the best at that.”Much of Clinton’s closing argument in Iowa and New Hampshire has centered around the idea that the policies put forward by Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, might sound appealing but are ultimately impractical.She has challenged the Vermont senator over his support for single-payer healthcare, which Clinton said poses an existential threat to Obama’s healthcare law, which remains popular among Democrats.“Senator Sanders wants to start over – to plunge us into a contentious national debate,” Clinton said, before noting how hard fought a victory healthcare had already been.“Stick with the Affordable Care Act, stick with making it better,” she said.Clinton also took a veiled shot at Sanders by vowing not to raise taxes on the middle class, following an acknowledgement by the senator’s campaign that his healthcare plan would require a tax hike on most Americans – in return, they say, for larger savings on insurance costs.“I will not raise middle class taxes – absolutely off the table. I will follow the money to the top,” Clinton said.There were, nonetheless, moments in which Clinton echoed Sanders’ economic populism.“We also have to keep our eye on Wall Street. We can’t ever let it wreck Main Street again,” she said.The crowd cheered frequently, but reserved its most thunderous reception for when Clinton ticked through priorities that included defending Planned Parenthood and marriage equality, protecting voting rights and pushing for criminal justice reform and gun control.“I’m a better candidate,” she told them, “and, thanks to you, I’ll be a better president.”Sabrina Siddiqui in Des Moines, Iowa@SabrinaSiddiqui",Web Resources,2016,"person, policy, ideology",['Wall Street reform']

Overhauling laws on labor unions would be a tougher sell, he said, given near-universal opposition among Republicans.Populist themes can be detected in Bidens tax proposals as well.

If signed, the executive action would call for a review of foreign trading practices and could, depending on the results, be followed by retaliatory trade measures from the administration. The action would additionally reflect a tension within the White House between the economic populists, who have argued for more aggressive and adversarial moves against foreign countries, and the growing influence of pragmatists, who have called for a more measured approach. 
During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked others countries over their trade practices, arguing other countries were contributing to the US trade deficit - the gap between the cost of a country's imports and its exports - by using subsidies and other practices to undercut US firms and lure away jobs. 
Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

In addition to hearing from Americans who will be impacted directly, Clinton’s team has consulted widely on student debt, including with the staff for the progressive Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.“There’s something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills they need in order to make the best of their own lives,” Clinton told an audience at an Iowa community college in April, as her campaign was just beginning.In the months since, however, progressive outsiders have successfully pushed – or at least nudged – Clinton to the left.Many groups had expressed hopes that Clinton would roll out a proposal for entirely debt-free college – not just tuition-free – such as the sweeping plans already proposed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley.Clinton’s plan still expects families to cover part of their tuition costs – through savings or loans. Under her plan, military veterans, lower-income students and 250,000 members of programs like AmeriCorps would attend college tuition-free.Other parents would still have to cover part of the costs for their children’s schooling.Even though it did not go as far as they hoped, leading debt-free groups lauded Clinton’s detailed proposal as contributing to a groundswell of support for an issue long ignored by the Washington mainstream.“Hillary Clinton’s plan is very big and ambitious – leading to debt-free college and increased economic opportunity for millions of Americans,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “The center of gravity on higher education has shifted from tinkering with interest rates to making college debt-free – and Clinton’s bold proposal is emblematic of the rising economic populist tide in American politics.”StrikeDebt, the Occupy movement’s offshoot which has forgiven millions in student debt, was less forgiving: “Hillary Clinton’s plan on student debt is designed to win votes and never become law,” the group tweeted after details of Clinton’s proposal leaked on Sunday. “It’s bait and nothing more. Don’t take the bait.”In May, Sanders introduced a Senate bill that would eliminate tuition at four-year public colleges and universities, which is estimated to cost $70bn a year.

It is difficult to figure out whether the interim agreement that the two sides are signing will make a major difference for the unemployed blue-collar workers who have lost their manufacturing jobs thanks to global competition from low-wage economies like that of China, and to the accelerated automation driven by the new technologies.

Yes, last night's results can be explained by Lamb's qualities as a candidate — he is a former prosecutor and ex-Marine whose cultural stances and temperament made him a good fit for the district. But if anything, this underscores the point: If Democrats can get good candidates who stress the importance of labor (which worked hard for Lamb's win) and popular social insurance programs, they can perform better among the very blue-collar voters who were lured away by Trump's phony economic populism — and who, apparently, are now not swayed by Trump's ongoing racial and cultural appeals, if the failure of Trump's burst of racism and authoritarianism at his last-minute rally is any indication. There is a robust argument underway among Democrats over whether they should prioritize outreach to the suburban and educated white voters, mostly women, who are deeply distressed and energized by Trump, or redouble their focus on the blue-collar whites that Trump lured away. But last night's results perhaps suggest that the GOP agenda is unpopular among both those demographics (as some Democratic pollsters have noted), meaning that this may be a false choice.

A White House tax plan released over the weekend promises to rekindle a long-simmering debate over how to use the tax code to close income gaps between the wealthy and the middle class. 

At a minimum, the plan represents President Barack Obama's opening bid to congressional Republicans in a potential negotiation over a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code, including the rules for individual taxpayers. Sharply negative reactions from GOP lawmakers suggested it is unlikely that many of Mr. Obama's ideas would become law in the current GOP-run Congress. 

In political terms, the plan appeared aimed at helping Mr. Obama cement a legacy as an economic populist, and could even help Democratic candidates stir middle-class support in the 2016 election. 

Republicans criticized the plan as not much more than that, saying it didn't appear to be aimed at advancing substantive legislation. Some even sought to cast Mr. Obama as a liberal outlier among Democrats, saying that he was seeking to overturn tax-rate policies of the Clinton era in the name of boosting taxes on the wealthy to pay for new middle-class wage supplements.

Opponents of lifting the ban generally use three points: 1) lifting the ban would increase drilling (anathema to environmentalists); 2) increases risk of oil spill/accident; and 3) the economic populist argument that lifting the ban could increase the price of gas at the pump.

The political views of non-voters, however, do differ somewhat from those of people who do vote – but often in ways that American liberals would not be happy about. In part because nonvoters tend to be less educated and more ignorant about politics than voters, they also tend to be more xenophobic, intolerant of racial and religious minorities, and more homophobic. They are more economically populist, as well, which translates into support for a larger welfare state, but also for various policies that go against basic economics 101 (including as understood by leading left-wing economists). If compulsory voting leads politicians to pay greater heed to the views of this group, the result will be policies that are more socially intolerant, more likely to be based on ignorance of economics, and more hostile to unpopular minority groups.

""I'm wary of the growing economic populism on the center-left and I believe an FTT is the kind of bold proposal that both makes sense on policy grounds and achieves important political objectives,"" Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, wrote in one email in August 2015. Financial Tax - Wall Street Paying for Main Street Gene Sperling, a longtime Clintonite, put the matter as succinctly as anyone, critic or advocate, ever has: ""Wall Street pays for Main Street."" Two months later, as part of a lengthy economic-reform proposal, Clinton called for a tax on financial transactions by high-frequency traders. ""Over the last decade, equity markets have become less transparent--often serving the interests of high-frequency traders and 'dark pool' operators at the expense of the investing public,"" Clinton wrote in the policy brief.

The campaign says the total cost of her proposal would be $350 billion over 10 years, with more than half of the cost going to grants for states and colleges to reduce tuition. It would be paid for by closing tax loopholes on higher earners. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which promotes liberal policies, called the plan ""very big and ambitious"" and a sign of ""rising economic populist tide in American politics."" Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank that has been a target of groups like the PCCC, also praised the plan while saying it ""opens up a whole new conversation on the Democratic side of the aisle,"" recognizing the problem goes beyond the amount of debt being accrued to the question of whether degrees are worth the cost. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who was consulted by the campaign as it drafted the plan, said there was reason to be optimistic some elements could be adopted, either as part of the debate over a new Higher Education Act reauthorization now underway in Congress, or through separate legislation.

3108972042,A Crossroads on Corporate Power,9/25/2024,Newstex,"In the 1980s, after a laissez-faire approach to antitrust laws originating with the Chicago school took hold in the Reagan administration, wealth inequality soared and new innovators struggled to break through an incumbency advantage favored by Wall Street.Only during the Biden administration have those trend lines begun to change, thanks to a new crop of antitrust regulators: Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter at the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Rohit Chopra have sent a clear message that the full body of anti-monopoly laws will be enforced to ensure open, competitive markets for consumers, businesses, and workers.The presidential election will decide whether this brief window of opportunity to radically reshape economic liberty in this country can fully take root as a more permanent policy structure. But the stakes for corporate power are uniquely multifaceted. It’s one of the rare policy areas where a baseline consensus has emerged, in large part because of a massive political shift since the 2008 financial crisis.On both the left and right, populist factions are battling it out with a more corporatist political establishment for the soul of their respective parties. But when it comes to the actual governing record, Democrats have been far more willing to challenge monopoly dominance than Republicans.More from Luke GoldsteinNotoriously erratic and fickle, Donald Trump has shed the economic populist instincts he tapped into during the 2016 campaign, and cozied up to segments of the business world that previously viewed him with suspicion. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, resisted articulating a full policy vision until early September, when her campaign finally launched an issues page on her website. The economic platform gestures at giving new powers to antitrust enforcers under the overall framing of going after “bad actors,” a vague designation that leaves a lot of questions up to interpretation.Despite Harris’s coy attitude toward policy, the political incentives are more aligned in the Democratic coalition for her to inherit the strongest administration on corporate power in decades, and give them four more years.BASED ON RECENT POLLING, A MAJORITY OF VOTERS blame corporate price-gouging for inflation and support breaking up monopolies as a tool against it. The C-suite executive class also views antitrust and competition policy as one of the top issues on the ballot this November, but for entirely different reasons.For months now, companies have been selectively timing the announcement of new acquisition targets, in the hopes of a more business-friendly administration with a more relaxed merger policy to wave deals through.",Web Resources,2024,"person, policy, group, ideology",['anti-trust']

His performance in the 2016 vice presidential debate with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) suggests he is up to the task and — unlike Trump — capable of relentlessly attacking an opponent without bulldozing standard decorum.But as he works to corner Harris on issues where she and Biden possess divergent views, Pence will have to fend off questions about his own record — from his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as head of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force to past statements he’s made about health care, systemic racism, trade and LGBTQ rights. One Democratic official said Harris has been encouraged to use Pence’s comments and policy record prior to his time in the White House to draw a contrast between him and Trump, whose economic populism and aggression toward China has sometimes put him at odds with positions previously held by his vice president.Meanwhile, Pence is expected to press the issues of court-packing and law and order during Wednesday’s event in Salt Lake City. Both Harris and Biden have sidestepped questions about whether they support calls by some Democrats to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court to counter its conservative majority, and Harris has been accused by the Trump campaign of endorsing rioters and looters after she promoted a bail fund on social media for demonstrators who were arrested during anti-racism protests.The court-packing issue is likely to underscore the contrast between Pence’s disciplined approach and Trump’s scattershot strategy, after the president was widely panned by his own aides and advisers for interjecting during the first debate when Biden appeared to be struggling with a clear response on the topic. The president interrupted at other points to accuse Biden of sidelining progressive voters with centrist positions, a claim that contradicted his broader attempt to cast the 74-year-old Democrat as a raging socialist. “The president has not been able to decide on a consistent line of attack against Biden,” Steel said.",Web Resources,2020,"person, policy",[]

When this combination of appeals delivered victory, it set off an interminable debate about whether to look at Trumpian populism primarily through the lens of race or economics. Interminable, but crucial, because the answer would say a lot about whether a less tribal political alignment is possible - with Democrats winning back blue-collar whites or Republicans building a pan-ethnic nationalism - or whether we're doomed to a permanent racial polarization of the parties. The strongest argument for privileging economics is a simple one: Trump won millions of working-class white voters in the Midwest, the constituency and the region hit hardest by globalization, who had previously voted for Barack Obama. If you voted twice for the first black president, this argument goes, your main political motivation probably isn't racism, and the fact that Trump ran as an economic populist seems like a more important explanatory fact. The rebuttal, the case for privileging race, relies on a raft of studies, the most recent one summarized by Vox's Zack Beauchamp just weeks before the midterms, which show that those Trump-Obama switchers were more likely to express racially conservative attitudes and hard-line anti-immigration views than they were to have suffered recent economic setbacks. The hypothesis floated by these studies' interpreters is that the combination of Obama's presidency and Trump's deliberate race-baiting had an activating effect on white anxiety. Racial backlash against the first black president was more limited in 2016 because Mitt Romney didn't play to racial fears, but the backlash escalated, and flipped more white voters, once the next Republican nominee did.",Newspapers,2018,"person, policy, ideology","['trade protectionism', 'infrastructure spending', 'entitlement protection']"

Yet Lamb did just fine defending the “progress” made by the ACA and promising to “fix what isn't working, and make the law better.”Lamb stayed away from another major progressive populist goal, a $15 minimum wage, which he said “sounds high based on what I’ve been told by many small-business owners in our area.” He did not endear himself to some environmentalists when he supported natural gas fracking, siding with energy industry workers still reeling from the decline of the coal industry. Since the Parkland massacre, progressive populists have been pushing Democrats to embrace gun control (though last year, many on the left excused candidates who married economic populism with gun rights such as Montana’s Rob Quist). Lamb began his campaign with a biographical spot showing him with an AR-15 and letting voters know he “still loves to shoot.” While he backed “universal background checks” after Parkland, he also reiterated his opposition to an assault weapons ban.He also emphasized bipartisanship, much like Sen. Doug Jones did in Alabama, running ads promising to “end the partisan divide,” venting about a “Congress where no one works together” and even throwing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi under the bus as an example of failed congressional leadership.

The Obama administration has not only highlighted this inconsistency in Mr Romney's populist rhetoric on China and global trade, but also decided to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Republican candidate on the issue, and try to demonstrate that it was really tough on China. Hence, the Obama administration announced on Monday that it was filing a new trade case against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) accusing the Chinese of providing US$1 billion in subsidies to exporters of cars and car parts between 2009 and 2011. Tough economic populist While the WTO is not expected to make a ruling on the issue before the November election, the filing of the complaint against China by Mr Obama allows him to pose as the tough economic populist in the presidential campaign who is protecting the American workers from the threat of a Chinese offensive aimed at destroying American jobs while depicting Mr Romney as the advocate of outsourcing during his time at Bain Capital and whose opposition to the auto bailout demonstrated his lack of support for American workers. Mr Obama's message that he ""killed Osama and saved General Motors"" - and who is now playing tough with the Chinese - could prove to be effective, especially in ""swing"" states such as Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with their large concentration of blue-collar workers, including those employed by the car industry.

We can turn it around and we can turn it around fast.""In a rare deviation from his prepared remarks, Trump urged voters to reject Clinton’s “policy of fear and her policy of absolute nonsense because it’s not working and it’s grossly incompetent and we can’t take it any longer, and we’re not going to take it any longer.”But in running to Clinton’s left on trade as part of a pitch to disaffected blue-collar workers in America’s Rust Belt, Trump managed to further alienate mainstream conservatives.“This speech flies in the face of what Republicans believe about markets and the economy and free trade,” said Tony Fratto, a Republican consultant and former assistant Treasury secretary. “I think it’s going to be much harder for him to consolidate support among Republicans after this speech.“Richard Trumka could have given that speech,” he continued, referencing the president of the AFL-CIO, the country’s biggest organized labor group.Amazingly enough, Trump’s speech brought Big Labor and the U.S.",Web Resources,2016,"person, policy, ideology",['trade protectionism']

Once the pandemic hit, the spending floodgates opened, with trillions of dollars spent with little consideration of fiscal restraint.Sadly, both parties now seem to represent the same toxic combination of high domestic spending, huge deficits, trade protectionism and gimmicky economic populism.

His efforts to cancel some student loan debt have also won praise from progressives, although that executive order has faced legal challenges.Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he still considers Biden’s most recent policy decisions to be “exceptions” rather than the rule of his governing philosophy. Pointing to Biden’s State of the Union address in February, Green said the president still appears committed to economic populist proposals like affordable healthcare and paid family leave.Casting our needs aside to appeal to a smaller faction of centrist voters is pretty foolishMichele Weindling of the Sunrise MovementHowever, Green added, Biden’s potential pivot to the political center could create an optics problem for the 2024 election if Trump wins the Republican nomination and “absurdly tries to claim the mantle of economic populism”. If Biden is perceived as being friendly with big oil or going soft on banking executives in response to the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, then it could create an opening for Trump to challenge Biden’s economic credentials, Green warned.With more than a year and a half to go until the election, Biden still has time to deliver more policy wins for his progressive supporters. Republicans now control the House of Representatives, complicating Democrats’ efforts to advance Biden’s legislative agenda, but the president still has the power of the executive pen.

And they are also both getting attacked early by another candidate — Pierre Poilievre, a seven-term MP positioning himself as an economic populist in this race.About an hour before Brown began, Poilievre’s campaign launched a video accusing Brown of being willing to do anything to win. Among things they highlighted was his pledge during the Ontario PC leadership race in 2015 that he’d revoke the federal carbon tax, which he walked back once elected.Brown tried to address that past support during his remarks Sunday, noting he has already called for the Liberals to freeze a planned increase in the carbon tax on April 1.The Poilievre campaign’s carbon tax jibe was aimed, however, at a sore spot in the party. In the 2020 federal Conservative leadership race, Erin O’Toole had also pledged to repeal the federal carbon tax, but when he won the contest, he also introduced his own version of a price on carbon, a move his detractors claimed was a total flip flop.Brown said the Conservative party needs to do better.“Past attempts by conservative parties in Canada to address climate change, including one that I led, haven’t been done in consultation with our membership or caucus.

Levitt noted how Democrats sought to partner with the industry — rather than battle it — to win support for their 2010 Affordable Care Act.

The future of Trumpism

A loose collection of writers and thinkers has been working to develop an alternative interpretation of the 2020 election, to pave the way for constructive policy debates in coming years. In this interpretation, Trump's loss should point to a way that some of the good-but-unrealized impulses of his presidency — the economic populism he ran on in 2016, his willingness to break with conservative economic orthodoxy dating back decades on issues such as trade — can be salvaged and built upon. One such effort comes from American Compass, a think tank working to craft a pro-worker conservative populism, which just released a new package taking stock of the Trump years. In their telling, Trump's trade policies were compromised by his utter unwillingness to develop a comprehensive industrial policy (something that also exacerbated the coronavirus catastrophe and cleared space for Biden to stake out his own industrial policy agenda).

This may have made a lot of sense in theory, but in reality one problem was that during all the years they have been bashing Obamacare, the Republicans have not even tried to come up with a detailed plan of their own, which they had to do in a rush during the first 50 days of the Trump presidency.  The second problem was that congressional Republicans were divided, between members of the so-called Freedom Caucus who were elected under the banner of the Tea-Party movement and who wanted to get rid of the entire Obamacare and shift responsibility for healthcare to the states, and more moderate Republicans such as Mr Ryan who basically wanted to restructure the ACA so as to reduce government subsidies for the plan.  And then there were the tensions between the pro-business Mr Ryan and the rest of the GOP establishment, and between the proponents of Mr Trump's economic populist-nationalist agenda, led by White House strategist Stephen Bannon. The populists were worried that Mr Ryan's proposals would end up hurting the white blue-collar workers in rural areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, who had secured Mr Trump's electoral victory and who continued to be dependent on government assistance.  In fact, populists such as Mr Bannon were toying with the idea of a single-payer healthcare system in which the state, rather than private insurers, pays for healthcare costs, a view that was echoed by Mr Trump during the election campaign when he expressed interest in Canada's national healthcare system.

""We won't be able to bring down Medicare drug prices, stop companies from outsourcing our jobs or start to rebuild the middle class until we can stem the unlimited influence special interest money applies over politicians.""
Hours later, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, another potential 2020 candidate, announced he'll also ban corporate PAC donations. Democratic strategists agree the decision is smart, and almost obvious — it will win Gillibrand points with the party's base, burnish her economic populist credentials, and distance her from Clinton, whose close ties to Wall Street and other corporate interests hurt her during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. It could also protect her from attacks like the one President Donald Trump launched against her last December, when he called the senator a ""lightweight"" who ""would do anything"" for campaign contributions.

Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist and former aide to the senator, said Gillibrand was wise to view Clinton's ""tone-deaf misread of where the base was when it came to money in politics"" as a ""cautionary tale,"" citing the backlash to Clinton's lucrative speeches for top banks.

She took companies like Levi's and General Electric to task for shifting parts of their production overseas as she pitched a $2 trillion plan to spur the research, manufacturing, and export of clean energy technology in the United States. “These giant corporations, they're not loyal to America, they're not loyal to American workers,"" Warren said, as members of the crowd cheered and even shook their fists. “Those giant corporations, they may not care about American workers, but I do.""
Beginning in a city that has become shorthand for the decline of American manufacturing, Warren's visit to Michigan on Tuesday — the first of her presidential campaign — was a potent backdrop for the launch of her new initiative to intervene more forcefully in the economy to shore up American jobs, a proposal she calls “economic patriotism."" 
But that plan, as well as her campaign event here, also highlighted that some aspects of Warren's economic populism have echoes of Trump's “America First"" economic nationalism, and underscored how the progressive wing of the Democratic Party has distanced itself from the more globalized trade policies of the Clinton and Obama presidencies. “I think there are parallels in terms of the emotion, that leaves people feeling aggrieved,"" said Stanley Greenberg, the pollster who famously wrote about disillusioned “Reagan Democrats"" in Macomb County, Mich., in the 1980s and who said Warren's policy-packed defense of America's economy could work here. “I think she's taking the case further, in terms of reform and economic policy, and so I think it's the right course for getting Michigan,"" Greenberg said.

One boatload is the corporate and individual tax cut, of which America’s richest 1 percent will take home an estimated 82 percent by 2027, according to the Tax Policy Center. Another boatload is coming from government itself, which Trump has filled with lobbyists who are letting large corporations do whatever they want — using public lands, polluting, defrauding consumers and investors, even employing children — in order to push profits even higher. Trump’s red meat for the white working class is initiatives and tirades against unauthorized immigrants and foreign traders — as if they’re responsible for the working class’s lost ground — and other symbolic gestures of economic populism, along with episodic racist outbursts, and support for guns and evangelicals. Every time Trump sends more money to the wealthy, he sends more red meat to his base. Weeks ago, after announcing he’d seek another big tax cut before the midterm elections — “phase two,” as he termed it — he threatened China with a trade war; arranged another crackdown on unauthorized immigrants, including a carefully choreographed plan to break up families at the border and attack sanctuary cities; and vowed to go after pharmaceutical companies.

One person with knowledge of the chaotic West Wing decision-making process said Mr Cohn and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, who had recommended the tariffs to the president, privately argued over the issue just hours before it was announced. The tariffs appeared to mark the tipping point for Mr Cohn, 57, a registered Democrat who made clear that he saw his job in the administration to be an advocate for business-friendly economic principles. He helped the president steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Mr Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. It was expected in the White House and on Capitol Hill that Mr Cohn would be more likely to leave the administration once the tax bill was signed into law.

A number of Republicans, who might have otherwise supported Trump’s action had they been involved in the process, sharply criticized the administration’s handling of the ordeal and called for swift changes.The botched rollout of the travel ban, according to a veteran of Capitol Hill and Republican campaigns, was emblematic of the challenges posed by the current power structure surrounding Trump.“There are not enough people of that ilk with the requisite experience to successfully operate the federal government,” said the strategist, who requested anonymity to speak more freely.“At the same time, the scope of the decisions that have to be made by the executive branch of the US government is so vast that you have to delegate power.”The tension surrounding the travel ban and its immediate aftermath also laid bare the fissures emerging between the various factions within the White House.As Bannon and Miller called the shots behind the scenes, crafting a policy that played directly to Trump’s base, Priebus and Spicer found themselves tasked with cleaning up the mess.Miller did, however, face the heat when MSNBC host Joe Scarborough launched into a stinging rebuke on his morning talkshow – regularly watched by Trump himself.“You’ve got a very young person in the White House on a power trip thinking that you can just write executive orders and tell all of your cabinet agencies to go to hell,” Scarborough said, before addressing Miller plainly.“By the time you’re 35, maybe you’ll know how Washington and the White House really works.“If you’re still around,” he added. “I hope you’re not.”Some close to Trump defended Miller, framing the outrage over the travel ban as driven by negative media coverage. Jason Miller, a former adviser to Trump, no relation to Stephen Miller, said the young aide had developed a unique understanding of Trump and his appeal on the campaign trail.“Steve really understands the economic populism movement both from his time working in conservative politics and being on the campaign trail,” Jason Miller told the Guardian.“He’s really clicked with the president and understands how the president wants to articulate and frame things.”Jason Miller also contested reports of dysfunction inside the West Wing, deeming many of the leaks from within the administration as the work of government officials who never wished for Trump to get elected.“Are some people getting their knickers in a twist because of the changes? Yeah,” he said. “But these are the things the president said he was going to fight for and advocate.”The core team at Trump’s side inside the Oval Office, Miller added, was unlikely to change.Trump’s campaign was nonetheless rocked by repeated shakeups. And the Trump White House is expected to be no different, where staffers of even the most even-keeled presidents are prone to burn out after only a few years.To some observers, those surrounding Trump are ultimately powerless in the face of a president who obsessively drives his own image.Referring to Trump’s contentious call with the Australian prime minister, Lindsey Graham said the incident was a precise example of where regardless of those standing at his shoulder, “the words of the president of the United States really matter”.“Eventually he’s the president.",Web Resources,2017,"person, policy, group",['economic populism']

On the left, lawmakers and strategists faulted Biden for not more aggressively highlighting corporate price-gouging, and Harris for what they characterized as her move away from economic populism and embrace of billionaires such as Mark Cuban.ADVERTISEMENTSome progressive lawmakers such as Sen.

Perhaps most notably, Biden successfully lobbied last year for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which represented the US’s most significant legislative response yet to the climate crisis. His efforts to cancel some student loan debt have also won praise from progressives, although that executive order has faced legal challenges.Adam Green, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he still considers Biden’s most recent policy decisions to be “exceptions” rather than the rule of his governing philosophy. Pointing to Biden’s State of the Union address in February, Green said the president still appears committed to economic populist proposals like affordable healthcare and paid family leave.Casting our needs aside to appeal to a smaller faction of centrist voters is pretty foolishMichele Weindling of the Sunrise MovementHowever, Green added, Biden’s potential pivot to the political center could create an optics problem for the 2024 election if Trump wins the Republican nomination and “absurdly tries to claim the mantle of economic populism”.

He had also campaigned against the GOP tax cuts as a giveaway to the rich -- and, importantly, blasted the tax cuts for creating deficits that would require deep cuts to entitlements, harming the middle class. Yes, these crucial results can be explained by Lamb's qualities as a candidate -- he is a former prosecutor and ex-Marine whose cultural stances and temperament made him a good fit for the district. But if anything, this underscores the point: If Democrats can get good candidates who stress the importance of labour (which worked hard for Lamb's win) and popular social insurance programs, they can win back some of the very blue collar voters who were lured away by Trump's economic populism -- and who, apparently, are now not swayed by Trump's ongoing racial and cultural appeals, if the failure of Trump's burst of racism and authoritarianism at his last-minute rally is any indication. There is a robust argument underway among Democrats over whether they should prioritise outreach to the suburban and educated white voters, mostly women, who are deeply distressed and energised by Trump, or redouble their focus on the blue collar whites that Trump lured away. But the recent results perhaps suggest that the GOP agenda is unpopular among both those demographics (as some Dem pollsters have noted), meaning that this may be a false choice.

Others, such as Autor and his colleagues, find that increased exposure to trade has led to political polarization in the United States, although there is vigorous debate over whether economic insecurity or racial attitudes, or some combination, best explain Trump's support among voters.

Edison Research projected the primary turnout of 1.7 million would surpass the 1.2 million who voted in 2016.In Washington state, Biden and Sanders were in a virtual tie with more than two-thirds of the votes counted.Michigan was the biggest and most competitive of the six states that held nominating contests on March 10, which also included North Dakota and Idaho.It also is a crucial battleground that Trump narrowly and unexpectedly won in 2016, which along with wins in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin propelled his ascent to the White House.The Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his dominant victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could be too much for Sanders to overcome, with the contest shifting to large states including Florida, Ohio and Georgia where Biden is seen as a clear favorite.By the end of March, about two-thirds of the nearly 4,000 delegates to July’s Democratic nominating convention will be allocated.So far on March 10, Biden had won 103 delegates to Sanders’ 48, giving him an overall lead of 731-593 in the race for the 1,991 delegates needed for the nomination, according to Edison Research.“The math says Joe is our prohibitive nominee. We need to bring the party together,” former presidential candidate Andrew Yang said on CNN as he endorsed Biden.One of Sanders’ most influential supporters, liberal US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, acknowledged the depth of his defeat.“There’s no sugar coating it,” she said on Instagram. “Tonight’s a tough night.”Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland on March 10 because of concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administration’s response.Biden was powered to victory on March 10 by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, union members and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls.In Michigan, he performed well with union members and working-class white voters — two groups that helped Sanders to an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016 but did not turn out as strongly for him this time despite Sanders’ economic populism and his call for universal healthcare.Sanders won large majorities of voters under 30 years old in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, yet that group had a smaller impact on the results this year.

That will alienate progressive Americans, and given Trump won a similar number of votes as 2020 – while Democrats haemorrhaged natural supporters who stayed home – this would be a political as well as a moral failure.

(Their headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, in an Art Deco tower in the shadow of the Citigroup Center.)
Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for “revolution,” finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that “Rewriting the Rules” might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party’s near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment. As the party heads into its convention in Philadelphia, this coalition sees encouraging signals — perhaps most notably the role that Elizabeth Warren, a key Roosevelt ally, has come to play in the campaign — that Hillary Clinton’s economic sympathies might ultimately lie further to the left than skeptics supposed.",Web Resources,2016,"person, policy, group, ideology",[]

Chuck Schumer for telling a reporter at the Democratic National Convention that he would seek a whole new approach to trade if he becomes majority leader. It also urged the Obama administration to again back off its push for a lame-duck TPP vote or risk damaging Clinton’s electoral chances.“By keeping the TPP on the table, President Obama is throwing into jeopardy Hillary Clinton's chances with key blue-collar swing voters and sabotaging her first-term agenda before she's even elected,” PCCC co-founder Adam Green said in a statement.U.S., JAPAN TO HOLD TRADE DIALOGUE: For once it’s not all about TPP.

The political views of non-voters, however, do differ somewhat from those of people who do vote -- but often in ways that American liberals would not be happy about. In part because nonvoters tend to be less educated and more ignorant about politics than voters, they also tend to be more xenophobic, intolerant of racial and religious minorities, and more homophobic. They are more economically populist, as well, which translates into support for a larger welfare state, but also for various policies that go against basic economics 101 (including as understood by leading left-wing economists). If compulsory voting leads politicians to pay greater heed the the views of this group, the result will be policies that are more socially intolerant, more likely to be based on ignorance of economics, and more hostile to unpopular minority groups. If there is any ideology that stands benefit from compulsory voting, it is relatively intolerant strains of big government social conservatism (the kinds of ideas associated with, e.g., Rick Santorum or Pat Buchanan in the US, or the National Front in France).

Mr. Rubin also admits that he underestimated the ""enormous costs"" of climate change when Vice President Al Gore warned him about the threat in the 1990s. He notes that his friend Tom Steyer, the billionaire co-founder of the hedge fund Farallon Capital, believes addressing climate change will boost the economy by developing new industries and creating new jobs.

With economic populism on the rise and politicians of all stripes calling to restrict trade to help American workers, Mr. Rubin defends the trade agreements of the Clinton administration. ""The politics of trade are always bad, but the substance is good,"" he says, noting that pacts with Mexico and China have allowed Americans to buy more goods at lower prices. 

He allows that cheaper labor overseas has undercut the country's manufacturing sector and cost jobs in the working and middle class, but says that the answer is more and better training for the many jobs that remain in health care and other sectors.

Another one of the deficiencies of Trump’s 2020 closing argument compared to the one he made when running against Clinton is the synergy between his paid media and his rhetoric. Tad Devine, who served as a senior adviser to John Kerry’s 2004 campaign against George W Bush, said Trump’s ads have largely lacked the focus they had in 2016. “When you look at the paid media, the last couple of weeks of the Trump campaign four years ago was very disciplined. It was a strong economic populist message that resonated, he was a very strong messenger for it, and it was about issues that affected the lives of people, particularly economic issues,” he said. “This time, we don’t really see that. It’s just a mixture of complaints, grievances, and a denial of reality.”
If Biden emerges from today’s election as a victorious president-elect, Devine said the former VP and his team deserve full credit for running what looks to have been a campaign perfectly adapted to the unique circumstances of running for president during a pandemic against an opponent who refuses to surrender the spotlight even for a minute. “They don’t get the credit they deserve for figuring out a strategy that would work… There were a lot of complaints in many quarters in the Democratic Party, for example, in the spring, that when Trump decided to go out there and be frenetic, have a news conference every day, and constantly be in front of the cameras, Biden had to do the same thing,” he said.",Newspapers,2020,"person, policy",[]

The tariffs appeared to mark the tipping point for Cohn, 57, a registered Democrat who made clear that he saw his job in the administration to be an advocate for business-friendly economic principles. He helped Trump steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. His departure may cause further turmoil in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an unpredictable administration, and leaves uncertainty about Trump's economic agenda.

Besides, if the racially tinged campaign of Mr. Northam’s opponent, Ed Gillespie, is indeed a preview of how Republicans plan to run in 2018, Democrats are going to have a hard time neutralizing cultural issues, and they’re going to struggle to win over rural voters who are motivated by these issues. Their best bet will be to offer a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters. The Virginia results suggest Democrats still might also be able to expand their base without attempting to reach these voters with a new economic populism — results that will certainly give comfort to the donor class of the party that gets nervous every time Bernie Sanders begins talking. The inevitable pendulum swing against the Republican Party, Mr. Trump’s deep unpopularity, an energized electorate and the wave of Republican congressional retirements — and the slow but steady demographic shift toward a younger, more diverse electorate — will all give Democrats an advantage that they can ride mostly just by being Democrats and not doing stupid things. Project this trend forward, and perhaps a just-out-of-reach suburban Atlanta House district that a Democratic nominee, Jon Ossoff, narrowly lost this year becomes a narrow Democratic pickup in 2018.

His canny central insight is that we have never recovered from the ruinous atomization of the Reagan Revolution, which depicted any government at all as “an alien spaceship descending on the happy residents of Middlesuburb, U.S.A., sucking up into itself all the resources, corrupting the children, and enslaving the population.” He notes, for example, that it was Bill Clinton who declared that “the era of big government is over” in 1996. Yes, I know he was “triangulating.” But he was abdicating too. But if Democratic politicians have largely abandoned New Deal policies, it is because their liberal base had by the 1980s lost interest in the kind of economic populism that had once been the party’s central creed. In the hands of the post-Vietnam left, Lilla argues, the individualism of the right became identity politics, an obsession with race, ethnicity and gender that blinded Democrats to unifying realities: “Reaganism for lefties.”
Some of what follows seems to borrow from conservative critiques of liberalism, which I suspect is why Lilla’s New York Times op-ed piece attracted so much ire.

He helped Trump steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. His departure may cause further turmoil in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an unpredictable administration, and leaves uncertainty about Trump's economic agenda. Trump expressed gratitude to Cohn in a written statement: ""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.""

Joe Biden wants to raise corporate taxes a trillion dollars over the next decade. Not a dime of that increase will go to cutting the budget deficit. That shouldn't surprise anyone who listens to Biden's economic populist mantra of getting corporations to pay their ""fair share"" of taxes.

But as we've seen just this week in California's Democratic primaries, progressives are still testing out a variety of approaches to problems of economic and racial inequality, searching for the policy proposals — a $15 minimum wage, free college tuition, abolishing ICE, ending mass incarceration — that will move the electoral needle. Meanwhile, still uncertain that the white working class will listen to economic populism if it's mixed with ""identity politics,"" some mainstream Democrats deeply fear that these progressive demands will continue to alienate voters lost to the GOP in the last election. The future of the Democratic Party, in other words, is still very much in flux. But progressives do have effective models for achieving the synthesis of race and class they desire.

Walz’s favorable rating was just 2 percentage points lower than his unfavorable rating in the Pew survey.“He is one hell of an effective communicator and an extraordinarily likable person,” Kamarck said.The trajectory of the two vice presidential campaigns has followed a familiar pattern: initial bursts of enthusiasm, followed by a more critical review of their past actions and statements.More attention has been focused on Vance’s past statements, including his suggestion in a 2021 speech that parents should have more voting power than other citizens. “If you don’t have as much of an investment in the future of this country,” he said, “maybe you shouldn’t get nearly the same voice.”During the campaign, Vance explained that his remarks on voting amounted to “a thought experiment” and not a serious policy proposal.The Republican’s past statements shadowed him again Friday, when the Washington Post revealed a previously secret online communication: “Trump has just so thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy),” Vance wrote in February 2020.The statement contradicted Vance’s public support of Trump and his previous claims that his skepticism about his current running mate faded after Trump’s strong performance in the White House. A spokesperson for Vance explained that, despite appearances, the previously private critique was actually aimed at “establishment Republicans who thwarted much of Trump’s populist economic agenda.”Walz also has been forced to explain some of his past statements, particularly his claim — during a discussion of gun control to curtail school shootings — about “weapons of war, that I carried in war.”Though he served in the National Guard for 24 years, Walz never deployed to a war zone. Pressed about his claim, the campaign released a statement saying that Walz “misspoke.”On the stump this summer, the specter of Vance’s previous controversies has often faded, allowing him to prosecute a familiar complaint: that Democrats presided over an economy that pushed prices out of sight.He told a rally in Raleigh, N.C., last week that eggs that once went for about $1.50 a dozen have jumped in price to “close to $4.” (Vance was lambasted for making the same claim at a Pennsylvania grocery story while standing in front of an egg display that showed a dozen priced at $2.99.)The GOP vice presidential candidate also said in the Tar Heel State that the price of ground beef had jumped up to nearly $6 a pound, which he blamed on “Kamala Harris’ policies,” adding: “We just need to get back to commonsense economic policies so that American families can afford to feed their children the food that they want.”Vance echoed Trump in blaming escalating prices in large part on higher fuel costs.

At HUD, he has focused on extending housing vouchers to domestic abuse victims and ending veteran homelessness.“People who view Secretary Clinton as too captive of the center might actually like to have Julian Castro on the ticket – he’s a progressive,” said Smith.Castro has deflected questions on his political ambitions, but many have viewed his move out of Texas and directly into the Obama administration as a hop-step introduction to national politics.“I’m trying to do a great job as HUD secretary. If you do a great job, that opens up opportunities, sometimes opportunities you don’t even see in the future,” he told the Daily Beast last month.The risk of over-thinking ageWhile Democratic aides uniformly sang Castro’s praises, one operative cautioned that “a younger running mate just for the sake of having a younger running mate isn’t good for either party”.“People see through optical moves,” the aide, who works on down-ballot elections, told the Guardian. “It’s the shifting of [Clinton’s] stance on certain issues – like economic populism – that is going to bring her more in line with the kids these days, if you will, more so than having a 40-year-old running mate.”Rubio’s own decision to emphasize age could backfire, as some of his prospective Republican opponents question whether he has the experience to take on the role of commander-in-chief.Former Texas governor Rick Perry, who may make his own second bid for president, drew a comparison between the likes of Rubio, 44-year-old Ted Cruz and 52-year-old Rand Paul to another “young, inexperienced senator”: Barack Obama.“Do you want to take a chance on someone who doesn’t have an executive track record of being an executive?

Recently, however, his campaign team appears to have removed the manifesto's reference to the MFN policy.The former Trump administration had finalized a most favored nation demonstration in 2020 that would have had Medicare pay no more for high-cost Part B drugs and biologics than the lowest price that drug makers charge in other developed countries. The demonstration also would have based Part B reimbursement for providers on the lowest drug prices in those countries.But the Biden CMS formally rescinded the demonstration in December 2021.In an exclusive interview with IHP in April, Joseph Grogan, who headed the Domestic Policy Council for the former Trump administration and is currently a scholar at University of Southern California Schaeffer Center, predicted Trump if president might renew implementation of the most favored nation policy using regulatory measures bolstered by the price regulations outlined in the IRA.This could entail introducing additional components and reinforce existing rules within a legal framework.""MFN (most favored nation) could be implemented through regulations but with the price-setting provisions of the IRA, you could add new elements and strengthen any rule legally,"" Grogan said.Alex Azar, who led HHS from 2018 to 2021, said in a webinar in August that Trump might not want to dismantle CMS' drug price negotiation program if reelected and could seek to please economic populists in the Republican Party by building on the program and out-negotiating the Biden administration by seeking to get even lower drug prices.Azar said Trump might ""try to out-IRA the Biden-Harris administration on negotiating"" if elected to a second term.In December 2023, Senate health committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said he would introduce legislation that would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging more in the United States than they do in comparable countries.

Warren's campaign has made other tactical alterations in a bid to revive its momentum.

She has more aggressively criticized Buttigieg and Biden, though usually not by name, for their ties to wealthy donors, while noting she has sworn off high-dollar fundraisers. Starting with a speech last Thursday in New Hampshire, Warren has also sought to return to the overarching themes of anti-corruption and economic populism that helped lift her campaign throughout the summer. In answering questions on everything from pollution to mental health, Warren returned again and again to her plan to tax the super-rich - including a wealth tax - to pay for a host of ambitious programs, including universal child care, student loan debt cancellation and tuition-free higher education. But she has continued to face persistent queries from voters on healthcare, including those who believe she is right on the issue but might pay the price in an election against Trump.

If signed, the executive action would call for a review of foreign trading practices and could, depending on the results, be followed by retaliatory trade measures from the administration. The action would additionally reflect a tension within the White House between the economic populists, who have argued for more aggressive and adversarial moves against foreign countries, and the growing influence of pragmatists, who have called for a more measured approach. 
During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked others countries over their trade practices, arguing other countries were contributing to the US trade deficit - the gap between the cost of a country's imports and its exports - by using subsidies and other practices to undercut US firms and lure away jobs. 
Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

To say that all these voters were motivated only by racism is to ignore the many tactical failures of the 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign.

The tariffs appeared to mark the tipping point for Cohn, 57, a registered Democrat who made clear that he saw his job in the administration to be an advocate for business-friendly economic principles. He helped Trump steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. His departure may cause further turmoil in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an unpredictable administration, and leaves uncertainty about Trump's economic agenda.

Just 4.3 percent of workers earn at or below the federal minimum wage, according to Labor Department data. Of those, 59 percent are part-time workers and almost half, 46 percent, are 24 years old or younger. 

Warren's anecdote capped a speech in which she reiterated her position that the Democratic Party must pursue an agenda of economic populism that includes higher minimum wages, using regulations to rein in Wall Street and resisting free trade. 

She said that despite some recent good economic news, such as the unemployment rate falling to 5.8 percent, ""for tens of millions of Americans the economy is not working.""

This may have made a lot of sense in theory, but in reality one problem was that during all the years they have been bashing Obamacare, the Republicans have not even tried to come up with a detailed plan of their own, which they had to do in a rush during the first 50 days of the Trump presidency. The second problem was that congressional Republicans were divided, between members of the so-called Freedom Caucus who were elected under the banner of the Tea-Party movement and who wanted to get rid of the entire Obamacare and shift responsibility for healthcare to the states, and more moderate Republicans such as Mr Ryan who basically wanted to restructure the ACA so as to reduce government subsidies for the plan. And then there were the tensions between the pro-business Mr Ryan and the rest of the GOP establishment, and between the proponents of Mr Trump's economic populist-nationalist agenda, led by White House strategist Stephen Bannon. The populists were worried that Mr Ryan's proposals would end up hurting the white blue-collar workers in rural areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, who had secured Mr Trump's electoral victory and who continued to be dependent on government assistance. In fact, populists such as Mr Bannon were toying with the idea of a single-payer healthcare system in which the state, rather than private insurers, pays for healthcare costs, a view that was echoed by Mr Trump during the election campaign when he expressed interest in Canada's national healthcare system. Bridging the differences among Republicans over healthcare would have been a difficult task under any condition, and became more like a mission impossible when Mr Ryan and his aides tried to author an Obamacare replacement while secluded for a few days in a hideout on Capitol Hill, taking little input from competing factions in the party.",Newspapers,2017,"person, policy, group, ideology",['single-payer healthcare']

As William Allen White, the famed progressive editor of the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette in the first half of the twentieth century, once wrote:
“Democracy is an experiment, and the right of the majority to rule is no more inherent than the right of the minority to rule; and unless the majority represents sane, righteous, unselfish public sentiment, it has no inherent right.”
(White also wrote: “My advice to the women of America is to raise more hell and fewer dahlias.”)

According to Dr. Skocpol, the answer will be determined partly by how we collectively choose to explain the president’s second-term victory. “There will be an attempt to downplay the role economic populism played,” Dr. Skocpol said. “I would expect a lot of the Wall Street Democratic crowd to place the emphasis on social issues and immigration. There will be an effort to define it that way.”
To put it another way, one emerging explanation of Mr. Obama’s victory will be that it was about demographics trumping economic policy.

If signed, the executive action would call for a review of foreign trading practices and could, depending on the results, be followed retaliatory trade measures from the administration. The action would additionally reflect a tension within the White House between the economic populists, who have argued for more aggressive and adversarial moves against foreign countries, and the growing influence of pragmatists, who have called for a more measured approach. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked others countries over their trade practices, arguing other countries were contributing to the US trade deficit - the gap between the cost of a country's imports and its exports - by using subsidies and other practices to undercut US firms and lure away jobs. Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules. Trump has argued that the US's trade deficit with China and Mexico is disproportionately large, and he has taken particular aim at China, accusing them of manipulating their currency to boost their exports.",Newspapers,2017,"person, policy, group, ideology",['trade protectionism']

Recently, however, his campaign team appears to have removed the manifesto's reference to the MFN policy.The former Trump administration had finalized a most favored nation demonstration in 2020 that would have had Medicare pay no more for high-cost Part B drugs and biologics than the lowest price that drug makers charge in other developed countries. The demonstration also would have based Part B reimbursement for providers on the lowest drug prices in those countries.But the Biden CMS formally rescinded the demonstration in December 2021.In an exclusive interview with IHP in April, Joseph Grogan, who headed the Domestic Policy Council for the former Trump administration and is currently a scholar at University of Southern California Schaeffer Center, predicted Trump if president might renew implementation of the most favored nation policy using regulatory measures bolstered by the price regulations outlined in the IRA.This could entail introducing additional components and reinforce existing rules within a legal framework.""MFN (most favored nation) could be implemented through regulations but with the price-setting provisions of the IRA, you could add new elements and strengthen any rule legally,"" Grogan said.Alex Azar, who led HHS from 2018 to 2021, said in a webinar in August that Trump might not want to dismantle CMS' drug price negotiation program if reelected and could seek to please economic populists in the Republican Party by building on the program and out-negotiating the Biden administration by seeking to get even lower drug prices.Azar said Trump might ""try to out-IRA the Biden-Harris administration on negotiating"" if elected to a second term.In December 2023, Senate health committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said he would introduce legislation that would prevent pharmaceutical companies from charging more in the United States than they do in comparable countries.

That puts them on a par with long-established lobbying powerhouses like the defense, automobile and banking industries.As they have tracked increasing public and political discontent with their size, power, handling of user data and role in elections, the four companies have intensified their efforts to lure lobbyists with strong connections to the White House, the regulatory agencies, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress.Of the 238 people registered to lobby for the four companies in the first three months of this year -- both in-house employees and those on contract from lobbying and law firms -- about 75 percent formerly served in the government or on political campaigns, according to an analysis of lobbying and employment records. Many worked in offices or for officials who could have a hand in deciding the course of the new governmental scrutiny.The influence campaigns encompass a broad range of activities, including calls on members of Congress, advertising, funding of think-tank research and efforts to get the attention of President Trump, whose on-again, off-again streak of economic populism is of particular concern to the big companies.Last month, the industry lobbying group, the Internet Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, awarded its Internet Freedom Award to Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and White House senior adviser.""They are no longer upstarts dipping a toe in lobbying,"" said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics.

Such economic populism doesn't guarantee victory, but it's probably the best option. Let's start by explaining the intraparty debate. There are four main explanations being given for Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat:

Harris is trying to say, essentially, that she'll be Biden but better. She'll use the power of government to help keep down the cost of living, after the administration she joined helped ignite the inflation problem. 

That might seem like another era of big government, but to be sure, her opponent is offering one too. Trump is promising an aggressive version of economic populism that would hike tariffs in an attempt to give him global leverage while cutting taxes in ways that would outstrip Harris' conceivable contributions to the deficit. 

It will be for voters to decide which of the two they prefer.

She emphasized tax breaks for families, as well as middle- and lower-income people, promising to expand the child tax credit to up to $3,600 -- and $6,000 for children in their first year of life.

Harris isn't looking for any radical departures from President Biden, who quit the race last month and endorsed her. Still, the vice president has embraced a dash of economic populism, shifting away from Biden's emphasis on job creation and infrastructure to matters more closely tied to easing the cost of living -- food prices, housing costs and tax breaks for families.

Harris on Friday will also announce plans to lower prescription drug and housing costs, the campaign said.Harris’s plans amount to a sharp escalation in the economic populism of even President Biden, who had already pulled the party to the left on economic policy compared with his Democratic predecessors. While offering some overtures to the business elite, Harris is attempting to respond to intense voter frustration over rising prices – particularly grocery prices – with a far-reaching proposal.Harris’s plan will include “the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries – setting clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can’t unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive corporate profits on food and groceries,” the campaign said in a statement.The exact details of the campaign’s plan were not immediately clear, but Harris said she would aim to enact the ban within her first 100 days, in part by directing the Federal Trade Commission to impose “harsh penalties” on firms that break new limits on “price gouging.” The statement did not define price gouging or “excessive” profits.Republican and many Democratic economists see mandatory price controls as a counterproductive form of government intervention that discourages firms from producing enough supply to meet demand.“This represents a return to the lazy, failed economic policies of the 1970s, when price controls proved to be a disaster for the economy,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. “It shows Harris is pandering for easy answers on the economy, even more aggressively than Biden had.

For example, if a lot is spent at the cost of massive debt, this translates into bread for today and hunger for tomorrow. At some point, the debt will have to be repaid with tax increases, spending adjustments, and obstacles to production, among others.Andrés Medina, economist and business consultant, explained that the two basic questions that citizens should ask themselves when faced with the candidates' proposals are: Where is the money going to come from? And what will be the effects that cannot be seen immediately or with the naked eye?""The populist approach in economic terms is always tremendously interventionist and aims to defend the welfare of the people, expanding public spending with a view to incentivizing economic growth and improving income distribution in favor of the traditionally less favored classes, in a model where political interests take precedence over the economic interests of society,"" he added.Phases of the modelEconomic populism has come to be called a kind of Latin American disease, which has caused the countries of the region never to get out of the pit of continuous crises, lack of employment and poverty.In addition to understanding the basic logics behind populist promises, it is also important to understandhow the populist cycle works in order to try not to fall into it again.Phase 1: This occurs before the populist politician comes to power. The context is one of a dissatisfied population, the economy is in crisis, public services have quality problems, corruption is widespread, and the general feeling is that social climbing is broken. Social frustration is growing and the majority of the population is looking for change.

Stephen Miller, the hard-charging architect of Trump's border policies and a onetime Rubio detractor, has called the senator ""one of the most deep, insightful and gifted thinkers on our political issues."" 

Once a leading voice for defending Ukraine, earlier this year Rubio voted against legislation that included billions in security aid, slamming the overall bill as ""moral extortion.""

Thus, the move is in part intended to counter the perception that the administration has been 'soft' on the banking sector  (see UNITED STATES: Despite FCIC, financial reform stalls - January  14, 2010).

Policy pivot  Before last week's about-face, administration policymakers, led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers, generally favoured a cautious, technocratic approach to financial sector reform.  The administration's tepid legislative proposals failed to attract much public enthusiasm, and prospects for significant legislation appeared poor.

The cost of health care remains a key issue in the 2024 presidential race, with the Democratic and Republican tickets both promising to lower prescription drug prices, provide more affordable coverage and pursue other solutions to improve patient access.

Levitt noted how Democrats sought to partner with the industry - rather than battle it - to win support for their 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Between 2007 and 2016, meanwhile, state spending per student declined nationwide by 18 percent. To compensate for these austerities, students and their families have taken on more debt, and public institutions have had to entice more out-of-state and international students able to pay full fare. In the name of anti-elitism and economic populism, legislatures have helped make state colleges and universities more exclusive, not less. “History,” as Robinson has said, “is a great ironist.”
While reading “What Are We Doing Here?,” I kept thinking of, in addition to my great-uncle, the students I teach at a public university in Detroit, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college, a large portion of whom are first- or second-generation Americans, many of whom observe a faith, many of whom do not, some of whom are majoring in the sciences, some in the humanities, nearly all of whom are anxious about their oncoming futures but nevertheless wish to study what we in the English department have to teach, having already gathered that although “it is difficult to get the news from poems,” as William Carlos Williams wrote, “men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.” I also kept thinking of my grandmother, who like Robinson was a mainline Protestant.

As if to exemplify the missed open goal, voters in the conservative states of Alaska and Missouri voted last week to implement a $15 minimum wage.When I think of the opportunities the Harris campaign missed to articulate even the most obvious financial hypocrisy on the other side, I am drawn back to a meeting I attended last month in Pittsburgh.

That has big implications for our perennial debate over the divergence between metropolitan and non-metro America.

But the stock market's concern that Medicare for All will be adopted appears to be diminishing, as indicated by the surge in insurers led by UnitedHealth Group (UNH) after it provided positive guidance Tuesday. The rest of the group followed, including Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina Healthcare (MOH.) 

Warren, whose front runner status made her the target of most of the other 11 on the debate stage, pushed her economic populism, which had a tax of 2% on wealth over $50 million, to fund myriad social programs. But Yang pointed out a number of European countries had dropped a wealth tax as unworkable. Instead, he proposed a value-added tax, a highly regressive levy, to pay for his agenda, the centerpiece of which is a universal basic income of $1,000 per month.

The problem, as Republicans are learning, is that most Americans do not believe that is what the tax plan will do. Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist, said that amid all the talk about the need to score an important victory for their party, “it bears mentioning that the ‘win’ is something that is extraordinarily unpopular with 75 percent of the American people.”
The tax proposal seems ill fitting for the mood on the right, perhaps explaining some of the skepticism. It would add $1 trillion to the deficit, according to the official congressional scorekeeper, contradicting the calls for fiscal austerity that conservatives made for years under President Barack Obama. And its generosity to corporations and the wealthiest Americans is at odds with the soak-the-rich economic populism President Trump preached during his campaign. But for groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, those in the Kochs’ vast network and others closely aligned with the pro-business wing of the Republican Party, the tax bill would be the only tangible legislative achievement after 11 months of an uneasy and, so far, unproductive alliance with a president they fiercely resisted during last year’s election.

In Florida, remember, Republican strength suggests that Democrats’ dalliance with socialists such as Bernie Sanders turned off Cuban American voters averse to that ideology, rather than indicating support for Trump’s anti-globalism.

The narrative these “national conservatives” have been crafting for months is that the Republicans have for too long been too much in thrall to free market libertarians on global trade and the movement of people. They see the party’s future as building further on Trump’s protectionism with new industrial strategies, buying American provisions, and the reshoring of American jobs.

It’s widely noted by sentient Democrats that the party’s base is too concentrated in the big coastal cities, college towns and minority enclaves. So far, even Trumpophobia is not strong enough to shift elections in places like Montana or Nebraska. It may work in the congressional special election in Georgia, although the Democrats have done themselves no favors by nominating a nonresident and untested filmmaker. To win in “flyover country,” the Democrats should follow the socially and environmentally moderate, economically populist course that was once the emblem of centrists and pragmatists like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin or North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp. Yet, such customized progressives run against the Stalinist notion of “intersectionality” that demands party members embrace every fashionable left-wing notion, from the “evils” of homeownership to police brutality, climate change and transgender bathrooms.

Why would Democrats be willing to touch this program, a crown jewel of progressive accomplishment? Because too many Democrats have done their own evolving into a form of species known as Midcenturia Republicanus.

Harris on Friday will also announce plans to lower prescription drug and housing costs, the campaign said.Harris's plans amount to a sharp escalation in the economic populism of even President Joe Biden, who had already pulled the party to the left on economic policy compared with his Democratic predecessors. While offering some overtures to the business elite, Harris is attempting to respond to intense voter frustration over rising prices - particularly grocery prices - with a far-reaching proposal.Harris's plan will include “the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries - setting clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can't unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive corporate profits on food and groceries,” the campaign said in a statement.The exact details of the campaign's plan were not immediately clear, but Harris said she would aim to enact the ban within her first 100 days, in part by directing the Federal Trade Commission to impose “harsh penalties” on firms that break new limits on “price gouging.” The statement did not define price gouging or “excessive” profits.Republican and many Democratic economists see mandatory price controls as a counterproductive form of government intervention that discourages firms from producing enough supply to meet demand.“This represents a return to the lazy, failed economic policies of the 1970s, when price controls proved to be a disaster for the economy,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. “It shows Harris is pandering for easy answers on the economy, even more aggressively than Biden had.

2829930879,Republican platform formalizes push for Donald Trump's Mexico border wall,7/19/2016,Guardian News & Media Limited,"While there are few surprises in its contents, much of which was made public at a meeting of the Republican platform committee last week, the influence of Trump is apparent, particularly on his signature issues of immigration reform and trade policy.The platform takes a hardline on immigration, calling for a border wall and “protecting all ports of entry”.“The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic,” it states.The document also demonstrates little sympathy for undocumented immigrants.Barack Obama’s executive orders in 2012 and 2014, which provided deportation relief to millions of immigrants brought to the US as children and immigrant parents of US citizens and lawful permanent residents, are dubbed “unlawful amnesties” and the document calls for a Republican president to immediately rescind them. It also casts suspicions on the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US and illegal immigration more broadly, as Trump has repeatedly done on the presidential campaign trail.“In a time of terrorism, drug cartels, human trafficking, and criminal gangs, the presence of millions of unidentified individuals in this country poses grave risks to the safety and sovereignty of the United States,” the platform reads.“Our highest priority, therefore, must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws.”While it does not endorse Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigration, the GOP agenda seeks “major changes” to how the US grants entry to refugees and asylum-seekers, stating that refugees who cannot be carefully vetted – “especially those whose homeland have been the breeding grounds for terrorism” – should be denied entry. There is also a mandate to apply “special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States from terror-sponsoring countries or from regions associated with Islamic terrorism”.Some Trump-like touches in the platform put Republicans at odds with party orthodoxy, particularly on trade and financial reform.While the platform predictably takes aim at Obama’s Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms, it also expresses support for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act – the Depression-era banking legislation that barred commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment. Given the objections to Glass-Steagall within the financial industry, the inclusion of such a proposal is a nod to the economic populism sweeping the country that Trump has sought to tap into.The GOP plank does not back away from the party’s long held support for free trade – despite Trump’s vocal opposition to trade agreements such as Nafta and the Trans-Pacific Partnership – but it parrots his “America-first” philosophy.The RNC also defeated a movement by socially moderate delegates to soften the party’s tone on LGBT rights. Last week, a faction of Republicans, including an openly gay delegate, aired concerns at the platform meeting that the party was alienating voters through its regressive stance on social equality. They had tried to strip the party’s platform of language deemed as discriminatory toward LGBT individuals, but threw in the towel after citing steep resistance from the RNC.As a result, the platform continues to define traditional marriage, between a man and a woman, as “the foundation for a free society” while condemning the supreme court’s ruling declaring gay marriage a constitutional right. Support for so-called religious freedom laws, which have been pushed by conservatives at the state level to deny services to LGBT individuals, is also made clear.The heads of the platform committee sought to downplay any internal discord on Monday, characterizing perceived divisions as a narrative constructed by the media.Virginia Foxx, a platform committee co-chair and congresswoman from North Carolina, told a group of committee members ahead of the floor vote that there had been too much focus on the negative.“We are going to take this country back, we are going to be making America great again,” she said, repeating Trump’s campaign slogan.",Web Resources,2016,"person, policy","['trade protectionism', 'banking/Wall Street/corporate reform']"

2246880947,Could Hillary Clinton Become the Champion of the 99 Percent?,7/23/2016,New York Times Company,"In the months leading up to its publication, the Roosevelt team was in close touch with Clinton speechwriters and advisers, and in subsequent rallies the candidate continued to draw upon the report, even at the level of explicit language; calls to ""rewrite the rules"" found their way into more of her addresses. The many news reports that linked the speech to Wong's organization consistently and erroneously relocated her team to Washington. (Their headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, in an Art Deco tower in the shadow of the Citigroup Center.)


Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for ""revolution,"" finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that ""Rewriting the Rules"" might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party's near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment. 

As the party heads into its convention in Philadelphia, this coalition sees encouraging signals -- perhaps most notably the role that Elizabeth Warren, a key Roosevelt ally, has come to play in the campaign -- that Hillary Clinton's economic sympathies might ultimately lie further to the left than skeptics supposed.",,2016,"person, policy, group, ideology",[]

Between 2007 and 2016, meanwhile, state spending per student declined nationwide by 18 percent. To compensate for these austerities, students and their families have taken on more debt, and public institutions have had to entice more out-of-state and international students able to pay full fare. In the name of anti-elitism and economic populism, legislatures have helped make state colleges and universities more exclusive, not less.”
The University of California system, long considered the strongest and deepest of America’s public universities, is very much subject to these national woes. But there are deeper problems here.

Trump's announcement on Thursday that he would press forward with a 25-per-cent tariff on steel imports and 10 per cent on aluminum left markets reeling and was a public rebuke of Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, who had furiously lobbied against the penalties. One person with knowledge of the chaotic West Wing decisionmaking process said Cohn and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who had recommended the tariffs to the president, privately argued over the issue just hours before it was announced. The tariffs appeared to mark the tipping point for Cohn, 57, a registered Democrat who made clear that he saw his job in the administration to be an advocate for business-friendly economic principles. He helped Trump steer a large package of tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. His departure may cause further turmoil in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an unpredictable administration, and leaves uncertainty about Trump's economic agenda.

Alaska voters also passed a pro-labor law — a ban on captive audience meetings, where employees require workers to listen to their views on politics or, typically, on labor unions. Union advocates say it's a way for companies to pressure workers against joining unions.Voters in Nebraska, another red state, also passed a paid sick leave measure.In Arizona, which still hasn't called its presidential winner, per the AP, voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would've lowered the minimum wage for tipped workers. Zoom out: There was a similar disconnect at play with referendums on abortion rights — voters passed measures protecting reproductive rights while voting for candidates who oppose abortion, as Axios' Maya Goldman writes.The big picture: It's perhaps not as surprising that voters chose both Trump and these typically Democratic pro-labor economic policies — the incoming president's brand of economic populism has strong appeal with working-class voters. The intrigue: At the same time, voters in blue states rejected liberal policies. In Massachusetts, a measure to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers was voted down by a wide margin.Oregon voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure that would have provided residents with a $1,600 annual rebate through an increase in the corporate sales tax.California voters approved a tough-on-crime measure making shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders.

Biden’s moderate twist on economic populism
Joe Biden is leading President Trump in polls on virtually every issue except the economy. Yesterday, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee unveiled an economic platform wrapped up in populism, in an effort to close that gap. “Build Back Better” is Mr. Biden’s slogan, with an emphasis on shoring up American manufacturing via huge investments in areas like 5G wireless technology and electric vehicles. He said it would be a level of spending “not seen since the Great Depression and World War II.”
He attacked Wall Street and big companies, saying that it was “way past time to put an end to shareholder capitalism” and criticizing Mr. Trump for focusing on the stock market as a barometer of America’s economic health.",Web Resources,2020,"person, policy, ideology","['infrastructure spending', 'trade protectionism', 'banking/Wall Street/corporate reform']"

The beauty of that middle-of-the-road, shared-sacrifice approach for the ruling class is that it locks in the surge in federal spending of the last five years. Americans must pay higher taxes to accommodate government spending that plateaus at 23% to 24% of GDP rather than the previous peacetime norm of 18% to 20%. Mayor Bloomberg states the obvious when he describes President Obama's budget strategy as economic populism that is not serious and the House agreed, rejecting the president's fiscal 2013 budget by a vote of 414 to 0. But Mr. Bloomberg also views conservative plans as ""divorced from reality."" In fact, conservative tax proposals generally produce federal revenues of about 18% of GDP over the next 10 years, right in line with the historical average. If all Bush tax rates are allowed to expire in 2013, as Mayor Bloomberg recommends, the CBO projects federal revenues will climb to about $41 trillion (roughly 21% of GDP, on average).

3094841864,Democrats warned to keep euphoria in check as election remains on knife-edge,8/21/2024,Guardian News & Media Limited,"Anxious Democratic strategists are quietly trying to douse the euphoria engulfing Kamala Harris ’s presidential campaign by warning that her surge in popularity masks an election contest that is on a knife-edge and could easily be lost.As the vice-president basks in adulation and optimism at the Democratic national convention in Chicago, key supporters are cautioning that more trying times lie ahead after an extended honeymoon period following her ascent to the top of the ticket in place of Joe Biden.Fuelling the Democrats’ feelgood mood have been a spate of opinion polls showing Harris with a national lead over Donald Trump while also leading or newly competitive in battleground states, including southern Sun belt states where Biden had been struggling badly before his withdrawal from the race last month.A recent compilation of national polls by 538, a polling website, showed Harris leading Trump by 46.6% to 43.8%.But Chauncey McLean, the president of Super Forward, a pro-Harris Super Pac that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Harris’s campaign, suggested that the poll figures concealed sobering realities.“Our numbers are much less rosy than what you’re seeing in public,” he told an event hosted by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics on the convention’s opening day on Monday.He described Pennsylvania, which he identified as the most critical of seven battleground states, as a “coin flip” between Harris and Trump.And despite the apparent resurrection in the Democrats’ prospects, the race overall remains as close as ever.“We have it tight as a tick, and pretty much across the board,” Reuters quoted McLean as saying. To win, he said, Harris must capture one of three states – Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Georgia. Recent surveys in the first two have recorded her with a narrow lead or neck-and-neck with Trump, while Trump leads by a wider margin in Georgia, a southern state that Biden won narrowly in 2020.McLean said Harris’s momentum stemmed from an early enthusiasm among young voters of colour in the Sun belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona.But she had yet to reassemble the coalition of Black, Hispanic and young voters that underpinned Biden’s victory four years ago. Internal polling shows that voters want more detail on policy.The cautionary theme was amplified by David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama, who told the Guardian this week that the Harris campaign must guard against complacency.“I think that if the Harris campaign has one message it will try to get across during this convention, it’s that there is no room for complacency in this election,” he said.The vice-president has already faced scrutiny over her recent disavowal of liberal policy positions she assumed during her ill-fated campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020, when she publicly opposed fracking and advocated a single-payer health insurance system that would ultimately have ended private health insurance.While subtly trying to stake out differences from Biden’s position on economic policy – a vulnerable area for Democrats – she has so far avoided one-on-one media interviews since being confirmed as the Democratic nominee, an approach that will need to be jettisoned as the campaign proceeds, thereby ushering in the dangers of public misstatements or policy pronouncements that prove unpopular.But in comments to the New York Times, Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, said embracing ideas of economic populism that are controversial because they run counter to the prevailing free-market neoliberal orthodoxy might be necessary to win precisely because they are attractive to Trump supporters.“I think that our coalition is bound to lose if we don’t find a way to reach out to some element of the folks who have been hoodwinked by Donald Trump,” he said. “We don’t have to win over 25% of his voters. We have to win 5 or 10% of his voters.”Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 presidential election campaigns told the Hill that Harris’s campaign needs to weather a storm at some point.“Every presidential campaign in modern history has had to go through an unanticipated scandal, crisis or world event, and at some point, that political law is going to happen to Kamala Harris’s campaign,” he said. “Until she passes that stress test – and I’m confident she will – this election is still wide open.",Web Resources,2024,"person, policy, ideology",['economic populism']

If signed, the executive action would call for a review of foreign trading practices and could, depending on the results, be followed by retaliatory trade measures from the administration. The action would additionally reflect a tension within the White House between the economic populists, who have argued for more aggressive and adversarial moves against foreign countries, and the growing influence of pragmatists, who have called for a more measured approach. 
During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked others countries over their trade practices, arguing other countries were contributing to the US trade deficit - the gap between the cost of a country's imports and its exports - by using subsidies and other practices to undercut US firms and lure away jobs. 
Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

Encouraging the switching of cars from one railway to another undermines the fluidity of our logistics chains and can lead to delays.

Asked about whether the campaign of Sanders offers the best hope of an alternative to the neoliberal-lite trajectory of the Democratic Party, Marcetic is emphatic:

Absolutely… Sanders’s campaign, in many ways, is sort of the heir to the Rainbow Coalition that Jesse Jackson ran in ’84 and again in ’88 – which, interestingly, by the way, Biden opposed… [Sanders] is trying to forge a new consensus much more similar to the New Deal tradition that [former President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt launched [in the 1930s] and that Biden was very briefly part of before taking a right turn very early on in his career. 
Marcetic pointed in particular to Sanders’s efforts to build a broad electoral coalition that could form a new voting bloc. He said:

Sanders’s theory is one that, through a program of economic populism – the kind that really has fallen out of favor in politics, not just in the Democratic Party but as a whole in the US and really the rest of the world since the global neoliberal turn in the 1980s, … [he] can knit together a broad coalition of voters… That worked for Roosevelt and the Democrats for a while… from the ’30s until about the 1970s… And I think that does probably represent the best case and the best path forward for getting us out of this rut and actually dealing with the just flurry of crises that are heading our way.   Democrats shifted to the right along with the whole politicial establishment 
Marcetic argued that the US political center of gravity, in general, is way to the right of other developed countries. For him, this was caused by a movement of powerful capitalist interests that conspired to push back against the New Deal coalition that developed under Roosevelt. He said:

In the 1930s, when Roosevelt launched the New Deal and really tried to reverse the huge concentration of wealth and inequality that had accrued over the past however many decades, there was a counter-movement launched by… some of the most powerful industrialists in the United States.",Web Resources,2020,"person, policy, ideology",['economic populism']

Republican Senator Pat Toomey beat Democratic candidate Katie McGinty by 7.65 per cent of the vote. One potential reason for Mr Trump’s surge in the area and why it swung hard right might be his economic populist message. One study after the 2016 presidential election noted that manufacturing jobs have dried up there. Today, Amazon is the largest employer in the county, followed by the federal government.

Another boatload is coming from government itself, which Trump has filled with lobbyists who are letting large corporations do whatever they want — using public lands, polluting, defrauding consumers and investors, even employing children — in order to push profits even higher. Trump’s red meat for the white working class is initiatives and tirades against unauthorized immigrants and foreign traders — as if they’re responsible for the working class’s lost ground — and other symbolic gestures of economic populism, along with episodic racist outbursts, and support for guns and evangelicals.

Hillary Clinton, whose candidacy was hurt by her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, was undoubtedly a poor vessel for the idea.Clinton is highly unlikely to be on the ballot again in 2020, in part because the Democrats are trying to build a message that can appeal to white working-class voters who previously embraced Donald Trump’s brand of populism. Postal banking is an idea tailor-made for the political environment.Under Gillibrand’s proposal, the Post Office would offer not only low-cost small-dollar loans, but also remittance services and checking and savings accounts that would come with debit cards and online services.The deposit accounts could be as large as $20,000 per account, according to the legislative text.

The promise of massive infrastructure spending may shrivel into an unambitious, cronyist tax-break-and-privatization scheme. The bluster about China and trade and NATO and the Export-Import Bank is all getting retracted in the face of reality. The vow not to touch entitlements cannot be squared with the ideological imperatives of congressional Republicans, so it has quietly been put in a drawer.More broadly, Trump is generally moving away from the economic populism that was supposed to make him different from other Republicans and increasingly embracing a more orthodox GOP governing approach, while doubling down on Trumpism's nativism and xenophobia. That approach is itself proving to have been based on unrealistic promises. Many congressional Republicans are not actually willing to roll back coverage for millions while deeply cutting taxes for the rich, it turns out; GOP fiscal priorities are deeply unpopular, and -- as I believe we will discover during the coming budgetary and tax reform debates -- mathematically unworkable.Many pundits are ascribing a number of Trump's recent reversals to a learning process, in which Trump is discovering that our challenges are much more complicated than he originally thought and is evolving accordingly.But as Brian Beutler points out in the New Republic, what all this really demonstrates is that the original slate of false promises and assumptions is failing him.As my attempted taxonomy of Trump's broken vows suggests, different groups of voters may be basing their conclusion that Trump isn't keeping his promises on different things.

As Jamison notes, this is a contrast to what Vance would say just a year and a half later as an Ohio Senate candidate, when he said Trump ""actually honored his promises."" Vance during the campaign would label Trump a ""great president.""
It's theoretically possible that Trump's actions at the end of his presidency changed Vance's mind, or that reflection brought Vance to a new verdict, as Vance has posited.

His departure may cause further turmoil in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an unpredictable administration, and leaves uncertainty about Trump's economic agenda.

An underlying premise of the campaigns of both Warren and Bernie Sanders is that taking radically progressive stands will motivate, enlarge and turn out the Democratic base, including minorities, the young and the poor; and that such positions are necessary to restore Democratic support among those who voted for third party candidates in 2016. “The path to victory is energizing and delivering to the base,” according to Justice Democrats, a group that backs progressive candidates, including those challenging Democratic incumbents: “Far too often, Democratic campaigns are designed to win over mushy milquetoast (and mythical) moderates, rather than excite the base.”
The group — which has strong ties to Bernie Sanders but more broadly backs candidates taking very progressive stands — argues that
Democratic primary voters support a populist progressive agenda that ties racial justice to progressive economic populism.

The huge $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill Biden has proposed is wildly popular. A CBS News poll last week found that 79% of Americans want Congress to pass a bill as big as the one Biden proposed, including 61% of Republicans.Biden isn’t stopping at pandemic relief. He’s also using the emergency to build support for the far broader program of economic reform he adopted midway through his campaign last year, including massive investments in manufacturing, technology, education and child care.“We’re in a position to think big and move big,” he said.He’s following the advice that Rahm Emanuel, then a member of Congress, offered during the financial crash of 2008: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.”For Biden, that begins with the pandemic relief plan, a package that includes a $1,400 check for most adults, increased unemployment insurance, a child tax credit of up to $3,600 a year, $440 billion for state and local governments and $130 billion to help reopen schools.And once that proposal is enacted, White House officials say, the president will turn to the broader, long-term economic proposals of his campaign, including a $400 billion “Buy American” plan to support manufacturing, $300 billion for research and development, more spending on clean energy and — if it doesn’t pass as part of the pandemic package — a $15 minimum wage.It’s an ambitious agenda: a dramatic expansion of federal government spending to create jobs, especially in manufacturing and strategic technologies.Biden’s economic populism is aimed, in part, at the same voters Donald Trump appealed to when he called for revitalizing American manufacturing and bringing jobs back home — but only in the sense that Biden, too, has promised to repair some of the damage wrought by the long decline in manufacturing jobs.“A lot of white working-class voters thought we forgot them,” he said last year during a campaign tour of faded industrial towns in Pennsylvania. “I get them. I get their sense of being left behind.”He’s kept a few of Trump’s policies, most notably the tough stance on trade with China.

For Biden, that begins with the pandemic relief plan, a package that includes a $1,400 check for most adults, increased unemployment insurance, a child tax credit of up to $3,600 a year, $440 billion for state and local governments and $130 billion to help reopen schools. And once that proposal is enacted, White House officials say, the president will turn to the broader, long-term economic proposals of his campaign, including a $400-billion “Buy American” plan to support manufacturing, $300 billion for research and development, more spending on clean energy and — if it doesn’t pass as part of the pandemic package — a $15 minimum wage. It’s an ambitious agenda: a dramatic expansion of federal government spending to create jobs, especially in manufacturing and strategic technologies. Biden’s economic populism is aimed, in part, at the same voters Donald Trump appealed to when he called for revitalizing American manufacturing and bringing jobs back home — but only in the sense that Biden, too, has promised to repair some of the damage wrought by the long decline in manufacturing jobs. “A lot of white working-class voters thought we forgot them,” he said last year during a campaign tour of faded industrial towns in Pennsylvania. “I get them.

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein announced her vice presidential choice on Wednesday, naming Cheri Honkala, an anti-poverty advocate from Philadelphia and national coordinator for the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign. 

""My running mate has been on the front lines fighting for the American poor, taking on the banks, taking on foreclosures, standing up for children most at risk,"" Ms. Stein said. 

Ms. Stein also said that her party, running heavily on environmental and economic populist themes, would compete nationally and take their message to the American people.

At an event at the National Press Club in Washington, Ms. Stein laid out her campaign platform, heavily emphasizing what she called ""the Green New Deal"" of economic justice and jobs for all Americans who want them, tough financial regulation, political reform to reduce the role of money in politics, and a transition to a ""green"" economy. 

Ms. Stein and her campaign manager, Ben Manski, said the Green Party will be on the presidential ballot in more than 40 states and this week filed for matching funds from the Federal Election Commission.

In July, reformers succeeded in writing strong antimonopoly language into the Democratic Party platform, the first time since 1988. In September, Renata Hesse, Obama's acting assistant attorney general for antitrust, delivered a speech that went a long way toward overturning the Chicago School approach to antitrust. But with the exception of Warren, most of today's Democrats, to the extent that they even understand the threat posed by monopoly, still treat competition policy as one of many potential solutions to the problems we face, an arrow of roughly equal importance with all the other arrows in the quiver, rather than as a philosophy able to guide how we see and think and act in all corners of the political economy. Donald Trump has proved that economic populism is smart politics. If Trump perfected a version of dangerous populism, based on resentment, xenophobia, and paranoia, then anti-monopolism is smart populism. Americans-all of them-have every right to be angry.

To woo them back, reclaim the center and assure electoral and governing relevance in 2012 and beyond, Democrats must make a big change: become the economic growth party. They must shift from being a party that seeks an expanded safety net to one obsessed about increasing the economic pie.  This means ditching economic populism, offering robust pro-growth policies and embracing fiscal responsibility. It also means taking on some sacred cows – like downsizing federal employee pensions.  A fundamental re-thinking of the Democratic vision is required. Start by recognizing that after passing universal health care – a tremendous triumph – Democrats now must read the memo: the 80-year quest to weave the perfect safety net is over.",Web Resources,2010,"ideology, policy",[]

Harris isn't looking for any radical departures from President Joe Biden, who stepped down from the race last month and endorsed her. Still, the vice president has embraced a dash of economic populism, shifting away from Biden's emphasis on job creation and infrastructure to matters more closely tied to easing the cost of living - food prices, housing costs and tax breaks for families. Much of what she's proposing would require congressional approval, which is far from assured in the current political environment, though, and Harris' campaign has offered scant details on how to pay for the ideas.

He also promised to deliver federal largesse the way Murtha had. Democrats will make even more of this result than is justified, given the area's past Democratic history.

Such economic populism doesn't guarantee victory, but it's probably the best option. Let's start by explaining the intraparty debate. There are four main explanations being given for Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat:

In the direct messages - sent during Trump's final year in office to an acquaintance over the social media platform then known as Twitter - Vance harshly criticized his future running mate's record of governance and said Trump had not fulfilled his economic agenda. ""Trump has just so thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy),"" Vance wrote in February 2020. He also offered a prediction: Joe Biden, he believed, was going to win the 2020 election.

The result previews a fresh wave of populism that could reshape yet another presidential campaign with about 18 months to go before voters decide whether to return Trump to the White House. 

This sentiment runs the deepest among Democratic and independent registered voters, but also exists among a significant slice of Republicans. About 8 in 10 Democrats and more than 6 in 10 independents say the country's economic system gives an advantage to those already in power, while nearly a third of Republicans share that view. 
What was Trump's big accomplishment, the tax plan, is now a symbol of his decision to abandon economic populism in favor of crony capitalism and huge tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Finally, the Mueller report makes 36 percent less likely to vote for him and only 14 percent more likely to vote for him, with the rest unchanged. Health care was the Republicans' Achilles' heel in 2018, and with Trump still vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act it could be in 2020 as well.

In other words, the negative impact of Trump's trade policies, and their unpopularity, actually increase the pressure on him to get a very good deal out of China, so he can justify the pain they've caused — while also ensuring that the political price he'll pay if he fails to get a good deal will be very high indeed. Failure on trade would be seriously problematic for Trump, because this is the one real remaining area where he can at least try to keep alive the illusion of the economic populism he ran on in 2016, having gone all in with conventional GOP economic orthodoxy with the big corporate tax cut and the failed effort to repeal Obamacare. As it is, Trump's policies in all of these areas — trade, taxes and health care — are turning out to be deeply unpopular.

Ever since the passage of the 16th Amendment, the individual income tax as a source of federal revenue has shot up higher and higher along with the growth of the central government itself. Replacing taxation on the hard work of Americans with the taxation on imports is at the heart of America First economic nationalism, and it would be the most profoundly revolutionary economic policy change in a century. This sweeping vision to reorient America’s taxation has been further augmented by more immediately achievable and economically populist policies like “no taxation on tips,” which Trump rolled out last month in a speech in Las Vegas, Nevada — the tip capital of America. While the so-called conventional-wisdom commentators responded with articles about its proposed costs of $250 billion to the federal budget, working-class Americans, including waiters and waitresses, heard a working-class tax cut at a time of rising costs for families and households. Furthermore, Americans across the online X-sphere backed Trump’s proposal with generous tips and a message that often read: “Vote for Trump, no taxes on your tips.” “No taxation without representation” is a slogan from the early days of the American Revolution.

The son took pains during his first go-round as governor to differentiate his politics from his father's. Brown was at the forefront of the first generation of post-New Deal neoliberals -- a cohort that included Gary Hart and Paul Tsongas -- who promoted environmentalism over growth and cultural liberalism over economic populism. With Brown, the tension between the two strands of liberalism at times seemed painfully Oedipal: As his father had embraced all rituals of the political life, so Brown took pleasure in shunning them. Brown is the last of the 1970s neos still governing, and while he has adopted his father's mantle of master builder -- albeit for greener purposes -- his resistance to convention, so apparent in his first tenure as governor, has expanded to include a resistance to novelty as well. Where he finds genuine technological breakthroughs, he wants to proceed ""at mach speed"": He is pushing the University of California to offer more classes online, partly as a way to hold down spiraling costs to students.",Web Resources,2013,"person, policy",[]

Ms Tennant's rally was held in a volunteer fire station packed with brawny union members, local politicians and her own family, who farm nearby. Ms Tennant defended coal as one of several forms of energy with which God had blessed West Virginia, along with gas, wind and solar power. To that careful centrism she added a dose of economic populism. Ms Tennant called herself pro-coal but also pro-coal miner, vowing to defend miners' rights to good health care and pensions, while casting her Republican opponent as an ally of heartless coal bosses.

1702838697,THE NATION; Clinton offers plan to cut student debt,8/11/2015,Los Angeles Times Communications LLC,"Clinton also would reduce the interest rate the government charges for Stafford loans so the program would break even, rather than generate a profit to the Treasury. Students could refinance outstanding loans at current lower rates, and future graduates would be eligible for an income-based repayment program, capping debt payments at 10% of their income. The campaign says the total cost of Clinton's proposal would be $350 billion over 10 years, and would be covered by closing tax loopholes on higher earners. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which promotes liberal policies, called the plan ""very big and ambitious"" and a sign of a ""rising economic populist tide in American politics."" Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank that has been a target of groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, also praised the plan while saying that it ""opens up a whole new conversation on the Democratic side of the aisle"": whether degrees are worth the cost. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute whom the campaign consulted, said there was reason to be optimistic that some elements of the plan could be adopted, either in a new Higher Education Act reauthorization underway in Congress or through separate legislation. Baum cited a number of factors that have led to the explosion of student debt, starting with the severity of the Great Recession and the rise of for-profit colleges.

2826864974,Out on the road with Sanders and Warren: Will the Democrats follow them to the left?,8/27/2017,Guardian News & Media Limited,"At Fellowship Chapel in west Detroit, Bernie Sanders delivered a thundering battle cry for the progressive movement before a crowd of nearly 2,000 people, squeezed into wooden pews and crowded into an overflow room.The town hall had the feeling of a revival meeting led by Sanders, who preached with the same urgency a message he delivered repeatedly on the 2016 presidential campaign trail: the system is rigged against the American people.But in Detroit he punctured the bleak prophecy with a glimmer of hope.“What this whole debate is about is what constitutes human rights: the right of freedom of speech, freedom of religion,” Sanders said. “Franklin Delano Roosevelt said we need economic rights, not just political rights. And healthcare is a human right.“The good news is that more people agree with us.”As Democrats feel their way out of the wilderness after sustaining one of the most stunning defeats in modern presidential history, the party’s ascendant left, emboldened by Sanders’s successes in 2016 and an energetic grassroots movement, is pressing ahead with an economic agenda that includes proposals for universal healthcare and debt-free college. And they are starting to feel that this may be their moment.Progressive leaders such as Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the firebrand from Massachusetts, have helped steer the party toward a platform of economic populism, which they believe is a political roadmap to winning back the House of Representatives – and possibly even the Senate – in next year’s congressional elections, and stopping Donald Trump’s agenda in its tracks.This week, Sanders and Warren, both of whom have moved to fill the leadership vacuum atop the Democratic party, hit the road to champion their progressive politics. Sanders held three events in Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016, a trip designed to show that his progressive ideas have appeal in rural America, while Warren, who is running for re-election to the Senate in 2018, crisscrossed Massachusetts to meet with constituents.At a town hall in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, Warren mocked her own wonkish reputation, stretching out her arms to illustrate a rising GDP chart, the start of her response to a question about how to address growing economic inequality.“OK, everyone settle in – she’s going to talk forever,” the former Harvard professor joked, before launching into a 10-minute critique of trickle-down economics.But Warren drew raucous applause when she told the crowd: “We have set up a series of policies in Washington that work for those at the top and leave everyone else behind. And what I say is it’s time to change that.”With polling indicating that support for a universal healthcare system in the US is growing, a number of progressive activists have declared the issue will be a “litmus test” for Democrats, threatening candidates who don’t support Sanders’s “single-payer” plan with a primary challenge.Warren rejects that kind of aggressive approach. “I don’t believe in litmus tests for Democrats,” she told reporters after the event.",Web Resources,2017,"person, policy, ideology","['universal healthcare', 'debt-free college']"
2012882282,"In Indiana, tariffs blessing and curse",3/12/2018,Gannett Media Corp,"Indiana's manufacturers have a different view. Many of those businesses use steel in their products, or sell their goods to other countries that might retaliate if the tariffs spark a  trade war. ""Since these manufacturing companies are such a large share of income and jobs in Indiana, it is likely that the Indiana economy would suffer from the tariffs even though we do produce aluminum and steel,"" said Wally Tyner, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University. That dichotomy helps explains why, in a state Trump won by 19 percentage points on an economic populist message, public officials are so divided over his policy.

Since the start of his second term, Obama has spent much of his political energy working to avert a new fiscal crisis with Republicans and attempting, but failing, to win tighter gun-control measures in Congress. Improving the economy -- one of the chief reasons for his election and among the most difficult challenges he has faced in office -- has faded as an issue in Washington amid steady if unspectacular job gains and modest economic growth. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in May found that 56 percent of Americans think the economy is improving, the highest number to say so since early 2009. Obama won reelection in large part on a message of economic populism -- a promise to protect the middle class from what he described as potentially harmful tax and budget policies promoted by Republicans. He devoted much of the first State of the Union address of his second term to the same theme, describing the importance of the government's role in training the next generation of workers for a new economy; building and improving airports, roads and trading hubs; and making college affordable for more Americans. But his agenda has faced stiff opposition in Congress, particularly in the Republican-controlled House.

About 14.6 million workers belonged to unions last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a 240,000-member drop from 2015.Though union ranks are shrinking, acceptance among conservatives seems to be rising, per the Gallup survey, which polled 1,000 people nationwide from  Aug. 2 to  6.Forty-two percent of Republicans said they approved of unions, a jump from 2011, when only 26 percent of Republicans showed support.Among Democrats, 81 percent of Democrats approved of unions, compared to 78 percent in 2011. Support among Independents has also climbed, reaching 61 percent from 52 percent six years ago.Joseph Slater, a law professor who follows labor issues at the University of Toledo College of Law, said one reason for the shift could be that more blue-collar workers have sided with the GOP since the 2016 campaign.""President Donald Trump ran as an economic populist and he was not himself anti-union,"" Slater said. Trump speaks often of boosting factory workers. He managed to flip counties across the Rust Belt - notably in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan - which felt disproportionate job loss as plants have shuttered, thanks to automation and foreign competition.Trump also continues to slam NAFTA, a move that could have come out of the AFL-CIO's playbook.

Trump’s highly charged comments come on the heels of a major policy speech on Tuesday in which he scorned the Republican Party’s traditional position in favor of trade deals and doubled down on his combative economic populism and protectionism while decrying the spread of globalism.  “This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally our middle class,"" said Trump at a plant south of Pittsburgh that provides aluminum scrap and other raw materials to the aluminum and steel industries.
