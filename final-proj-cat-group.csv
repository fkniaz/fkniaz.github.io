and German elections. One unifying point in each of these elections is the rise of economic populism, with sluggish economic growth and rising inequality stoking anti-establishment movements. Thus far, however, populism has yet to translate into signicant shifts in economic policy.

And that's not just a problem for the advocates, it's a problem for those they purport to represent.”Democrats to Moulton's left have offered very different assessments of where they think their party went wrong and what they see as the path forward.US Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose presidential campaign was famously built on her “having a plan for everything,” published a “plan to fight back” in Time Magazine on Thursday.While Harris “deserves credit for running an inspiring campaign under unprecedented circumstances,” Warren wrote, she urged Democrats to “unrig the economy” to win back working-class voters.She called on Democrats to step up oversight efforts in Congress, fight Trump in the courts, get involved at the grassroots level, and, most pressingly, for the Senate to use the remaining time before the new Congress takes office to confirm federal judges and key regulators while they still have power.Her assessment was similar to, though less scathing than, one offered by progressive Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sanders, who has drawn criticism in recent days for bashing party leadership, wrote in a Globe op-ed on Sunday that “Democrats lost this election because they ignored the justified anger of working-class America and became the defenders of a rigged economic and political system.”The two New England senators' takes on the election, which align neatly with their personal policy preferences, show how legislators have retreated to their party factions as they assign blame for Democrats' overwhelming losses.Representative Jake Auchincloss, another moderate Democrat in the state's congressional delegation, told the Globe on Monday that in his district — where one of the biggest cities, Fall River, voted for a Republican for the first time in a century — there was “a sense that Democrats are not working for them.”Asked about Moulton's assessment of where Democrats were missing the mark, Auchincloss declined to directly address his colleague's take.”We certainly need to be able to have hard conversations as a party,” he said. “I'm actually less worried, though, about where Democrats are debating things, and I'm more worried about where they seem to be in strong agreement.”He pushed back on what he saw as Democrats looking to “dial up economic populism” and cautioned against “trying to backpedal into a MAGA-lite party.” The party, he said, needs to put forth a more “authentic agenda,” which would include items such as balancing the budget, securing the southern border, and building more affordable housing.Those in the LGTBQ+ community said in the end, by singling out the transgender community, whatever his motives, Moulton played into the GOP agenda, rather than effectively critiquing the Democratic one.“You have joined [the Trump agenda],” Giselle Byrd, a trans advocate and executive director of Boston's The Theater Offensive said of Moulton. “Congressman Moulton's comments are not only riddled with transphobia, but they send a message of fear-mongering throughout this country in a time where we are already experiencing that.”Matt Stout and Anjali Huynh of the Globe staff contributed to this report.",Newspapers,2024,"person, policy, group, ideology","['progressives', 'working-class America']"

The unholy matrimony of labor interests and right wing economic populists that flocked to trade restrictions after the passage of NAFTA in 1994 has finally come to fruition. Today’s GOP has largely abandoned its former alliance with Reaganite free trade in favor of tariffs on allies and trade wars with China. This has had measured adverse effects on the very sectors meant to be aided by protectionist policy — manufacturing and agriculture.

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me. She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”
Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

This is a policy view, but knowing that the broader Democratic Party is more united around beating Republicans than any set of policies, this bloc uses election narratives to push its policy stances.

Hopkins noted that
The tension between the center and the fervent anti-corporate, anti-Wall Street wing of the party — Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren and now Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — has amplified intraparty conflict. While some centrist Democrats and organizations with which they are allied view economic populists as an electoral liability, they are, among other things, crucial to keeping within the Democratic fold a bloc of voters who can drift in small but significant numbers to third-party candidates , like Jill Stein in 2016 and Ralph Nader in 2000, who arguably prevented Democratic candidates from winning the presidency. While both parties are penalized for their internal divisions, there is some evidence that cultural and economic strains present particular challenges for Democrats.

Despite all that, politics is never pre-determined, and demographics alone will not deliver more progressive gains and achievements. The fragmented American constitutional system--coupled with the ideological unity of congressional Republicans--gives conservatives multiple veto points over progressive legislation as they control many state houses and governor's mansions, increasing their ability to block federal action on matters such as health care and encouraging further attacks on public employees and benefits for the poor, and punitive social policies aimed at communities of color and gays and lesbians.

And if Mr. Biden’s approach up to this point has been good enough to keep roughly 53 percent of the country solidly with him, it might not take a major political breakthrough — let alone a season of them — to reinforce that coalition by winning over just a small slice of doubters or critics. There are strategists in Mr. Biden’s coalition who hope to do considerably more than that, either by maneuvering the Democratic Party more decisively toward the political center or by competing more assertively with Republicans on themes of economic populism (or perhaps through some combination of the two). Mr. Biden’s aides have already briefed congressional Democrats several times on their plans to lean hard into promoting the economic recovery as the governing party’s signature achievement — one they hope to reinforce further with a victory on infrastructure.

The Democratic candidate bets on voters who, like him, emphasize other aspects of Catholic social education that focus on caring for the poor and vulnerable. These Catholics say that the doctrine of their church forces them to welcome immigrants and refugees and to support trade unions and social welfare programs and not just vote on the issue of abortion.""I struggled politically with the idea of being pro-life versus pro-election,"" said Monica Alaniz-McGinnis, 43, of Mission, Texas, in reference to her Catholic upbringing. But she supports the right to abortion and is extremely concerned about Republicans' efforts to expedite the appointment of another conservative judge to the Supreme Court.Overall, 56 percent of Catholic adults are in favor of the right to abortion, according to a survey conducted last year by the Pew Research Center, despite the church's position on the issue.And while many practicing Catholics oppose abortion, some argue that it is only one issue among many and that the Affordable Care Act, with its expansion of access to health care, can prevent more long-term abortions than a Supreme Court ruling prohibiting the procedure.In addition to surprising notes of economic populism and white complaints, Trump's message to white Catholics focuses heavily on abortion and what his team frames as issues of religious freedom.The president, who has claimed to be a Presbyterian, rarely attends church, and in 2016 had a disagreement with Pope Francis.However, its allies coincide in particular with the most religious voters; specifical, evangelicals who pushed Trump's rise to the White House in 2016. Several of the current and past senior government officials are conservative Catholics and the president's wife, Melania, is also Catholic.For Biden, the speech is more personal. He goes to church once a week and usually carries a rosary with him (""The next Republican who tells me I'm not religious, I'm going to put my rosary bills down his throat,"" he said in 2005, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer) and has a habit of persigning himself when he's considering making a provocative joke.Surveys of Catholic voters, which were mostly conducted before the death of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, show a mixed political picture.The Pew Research Center found that Trump continued to do well among white Catholics even in the summer, when his numbers in national polls were low due to his handling of the coronavirus crisis.However, PRRI surveys found that, in thespring and summer, Trump's preference among this group fell to less than 40 percent. The organization's new data found that this percentage has increased to a 54 percent preference among white Catholics.However, Jones, the CEO of the PRRI, saw the volatility of this group's attitudes as a persistent warning sign to the president.""That's a group that Trump easily won from and yet now says his preference is divided.",Newspapers,2020,"person, group",[]

Iowa's rightward shift was evident in 2014 when Joni Ernst, a Republican, captured the Senate seat held for 30 years by Democrat Tom Harkin, with a folksy campaign that emphasized her upbringing on a farm. That trend accelerated with Trump, who placed second in Iowa's 2016 Republican caucuses, but won the state resoundingly in the general election. Democrat Hillary Clinton turned off some voters, while Trump's appeals to block illegal immigration and economic populism resonated with them.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

""Reagan may have been a conservative, but he wasn't a nationalist. Reagan got the big issues of the future wrong -- foreign policy, trade and immigration.""The ascendancy of Donald Trump, whose economic populism and nationalist instincts are at odds with the free-enterprise principles and foreign-policy idealism of Reaganism, has been the main driver of Mr. Reagan's reassessment. A Pew poll last year found that 41 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Mr. Reagan as the best president of the past 40 years, while 37 percent awarded that laurel to Mr. Trump.The result is a veritable schism on the right over Mr. Reagan's legacy, and more broadly, over whether the conservative past should shape its future. What's perhaps most telling about this internal battle, however, is that the various factions -- those who reject Reaganism, those who defend it and those who stress the commonalities between Reaganism and Trumpism -- all tend to paint portraits of Mr. Reagan that omit the very attributes that made him such a broadly popular political figure: his pragmatism and nose for compromise.That oversight, unless and until it is corrected, bodes poorly for the future of the conservative movement and the Republican Party.The group driving the debate over Mr. Reagan's legacy -- call them the dissenters -- seeks to bury his influence.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

Earlier that day, Clinton expressed outrage that a heavily subsidized Nabisco factory in the Chicago area was in the process of laying off workers and moving jobs out of state. She scolded Nabisco for not working harder to keep the plant intact, and she said firms like Nabisco, which got tax breaks and then leave anyway ""should have to pay that money back."" The funds should ""be used to reinvest in the community and the workers,"" she said. In the process of winning over Democrats in the Rust Belt, Clinton began to sound a lot like her more progressive rival -- so much so that activists supporting him declared victory Tuesday night. ""Hillary Clinton won Ohio and had a Super Tuesday by riding the economic populist tide instead of fighting it,"" said a statement from Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

Donald Trump’s devastating victory reflects the pervasive appeal of a populist platform. His campaign’s anti-immigrant, white nationalist rhetoric is disgusting and terrifying — and yet his buffoonish running mate’s economic populism, while often misguided, champions the kind of distrust of corporations that you might expect to hear from Bernie Sanders. In response, Princetonians should break out of the Orange Bubble and engage with the communities Trump’s message has resonated with. According to many economists, Harris’s policy proposals would be better for working class Americans than Trump’s, and yet white, working class voters overwhelmingly support the felon and demagogue poised to retake the White House. There’s a reason for this cognitive dissonance: Democrats aren’t embracing the progressive economic populism that could help them win back the working class, even though research shows that putting forth economically populist candidates from working-class backgrounds is an effective strategy.",Newspapers,2024,"person, ideology, group",['working class']

The sheer size of the group Sanders brought together will be able to survive when people get tired and fall away, and has the potential to grow, especially among the economic populists who are drawn to Trump.

According to a campaign representative, the successive endorsements were intended to demonstrate that green initiatives on jobs and climate change do not jeopardize workers' rights.During his speech, Biden blasted billionaires for contributing as little as 8% to federal taxes.

2830224570,'Tea Party of the left': Bernie Sanders' ethos endures in impending Trump era,11/15/2016,Guardian News & Media Limited,"They want to march because they’re angry about the electoral college, they’re upset with Americans who think it’s OK for someone who campaigned with anti-gay, anti-Muslim rhetoric to now be president.“And our goal is to channel all of that energy into the 2018 midterms and 2020.”Ahmed compared the climate to 2008 when Obama won the presidency and the Democratic party controlled both the Senate and House. That spurred a conservative movement that saw a number of rightwing Republicans elected in the 2010 midterm elections.“It’s really like that’s the moment where the Tea Party mobilised. How we’re feeling right now that’s how they felt when Obama won. So that’s what we think will happen here as well,” she said.“You’re probably going to see some sort of actual Tea Party of the left.”Wong and Ahmed’s efforts are representative of a flurry of activity at all levels of the progressive movement.At the top level, Sanders, who in July announced he would return to the Senate as an independent, despite having won 13m votes in the Democratic primary, has been pressuring the Democratic National Committee to adopt the left-leaning Keith Ellison as its chair.At a grassroots level are events like RootsCamp, the anti-Trump protests that have taken place across the country, and a “People’s Rally” due to take place in DC on Thursday.Sanders himself will speak at that event, which was originally planned as an anti-Trans-Pacific Partnership event.People’s Action, a progressive organisation with more than a million volunteers and 600 paid organizers, is another activist group laying specific plans for the coming months.George Goehl, the organisation’s co-director, said People’s Action is aiming to target people across the rust belt and in swing states who backed Trump as a protest vote, and draw their attention to the difference between Trump the presidential candidate and Trump the president.“To expose that there’s no plans to move an economic populist agenda in a Trump presidency,” Goehl said.“He closed hard with the ‘drain the swamp’ message. I feel like in the last two or three weeks that was a message he pushed hard.“And he’s already pretty quickly refilled the swamp. With Priebus and the people he’s surrounding himself with: lobbyists, consultants, lots of people who are guilty of the kind of revolving door from Congress to lobbyist to Congress.”Goehl said the group would focus on issues at a local level. In October Cook County, in Illinois, implemented a $13-an-hour minimum wage after lobbying by People’s Action.“I see a lot of momentum building in states and in organisations like ours around down-ballot, bottom-up political movement work,” Goehl said.“In 2017, 48 of the 100 biggest cities in the country have municipal elections.",Web Resources,2016,"group, ideology","['progressives', 'People\'s Action']"

3082065136,Donald Trump’s political power has never been greater,7/17/2024,Nationwide News Pty Ltd,"Trump was already ahead of Joe Biden in most opinion polls before the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, but his poise under fire has bestowed a martyr-like status on the Republican presidential nominee – at least among the party’s base, which can unify his supporters and probably attract new ones.It already looks as though Trump is running the show. Biden agreed to provide independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy with Secret Service protection this week just a few hours after Trump demanded it.The former president’s power within the Republican Party has been supercharged as much as it has outside it, clearly illustrated on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) when his former bitter competitor Nikki Haley, who only months ago indicated she might not vote for Trump, gave him a ringing ­endorsement on the stage at the convention in Milwaukee.So did Trump’s other former rival for the GOP nomination, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.It’s Trump’s Republican Party now more than it ever has been, and it will likely remain so for many years into the future.Until the weekend’s historic murder attempt, Trump had been reportedly torn between picking a more traditional Republican as his running mate, such as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Florida senator Marco Rubio, as a way to unify a party polarised after the primaries. He was counselled to pick a woman to try to win over college-educated female voters, the demographic among whom he polls worst.But after his unexpected political elevation he’s opted for JD Vance, a young MAGA firebrand more associated with Trump’s brand and politics than any other potential candidate. He has set up the eloquent, 39-year-old senator to run for president in 2028 – much as Dwight Eisenhower once did by choosing a young Richard Nixon as his running mate in 1952 – ensuring MAGA values around economic populism and foreign policy isolationism last well beyond any second Trump term.Valid questions about the competence of the Secret Service in keeping the former president safe – the gunman was able to fire three shots from a nearby rooftop before he was “neutralised” – have played into MAGA talking points about the competence and impartiality of federal law enforcement agencies.Democrats nervously awaiting fresh polling data since the weekend’s shocking attempt on the former president’s life at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, would already have noticed Trump’s chance of winning a second term had shot up to 66 per cent from 56 per cent, the highest yet, according to RealClear Politics’ average of eight political ­betting markets.Many Republican and Democratic strategists alike have now written off Biden’s chances in ­November. His candidacy had already been severely hobbled by his own declining competence, illustrated by endless gaffes and incoherent mumbling in his public appearances. “The landslide will be even bigger now,” veteran Trump critic Andrew Sullivan wrote on his widely read blog – even if Biden is ultimately pushed out, a scenario that has become less likely given fewer top Democrats would want to take on a resurgent Trump and lose.Democrats have had to dial down their rhetoric against Trump, at least for a time, and pull their campaign ads as they assess the political fallout of the first assassination attempt on a current or former president since 1981.Trump’s own convention speech on Thursday night (Friday AEST) will be revealing: will he opt for a new, unifying message to the nation, dumping his trademark dark brooding on America’s alleged terminal decline under Democrat rule? Democrats will be hoping his near-death experience doesn’t change his political style, but Trump’s more disciplined campaigning and speaking, in evidence at least since he thrashed Biden in June’s first presidential debate, suggest they could be in for a disappointment.",Newspapers,2024,"person, group",['MAGA']

During the first half of this year, Obama shifted from income inequality to the more politically palatable theme of lifting the middle class, focusing on issues such as the minimum wage and the gender pay gap that are thought to resonate with a broader group of voters. The pivot is striking for a president who identified inequality as one of his top concerns after his reelection, calling it ""a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life and what we stand for around the globe."" The shift also underscores the ongoing dispute between the Democratic Party's liberal and moderate wings over how to address inequality issues.

the Republican Party managed to persuade many working-class whites to support their economic agenda not only by contrasting it with Democrats’ emphasis on racial equity but also by arguing that small government, economically conservative policy rewards hard work. The persuasiveness of this message waned, however, with increasing inequality, low income growth, rural job loss, etc., creating an opening for Trump. His 2016 campaign directly addressed working-class whites’ economic concerns, even if his policies in office generally did not. With the Vance pick, we are seeing an even greater rhetorical shift toward economic populism aimed directly at working-class and rural voters, and it is likely that a second Trump term would advance more populist policy than the first. There is a clear underlying logic to the Trump 2024 agenda, according to Christine Reyna, a professor of psychology at DePaul University, who wrote by email:
Regarding the seemingly contradictory policies of the MAGA platform, they actually align perfectly with a populist agenda. Populism is not a stand-alone ideology so much as a framework/narrative that centers the grievances and needs of the “noble” citizens against the greedy, amorphous “elites.”

And their chosen Democrats have lost primaries: in Nebraska, a former congressman backed by the DCCC, Brad Ashford, lost a May primary to a progressive insurgent, Kara Eastman. Two more moderates in Pennsylvania fell to challengers on the left.Given the progressive energy animating these contests – and the fact that economic populism has been proven to be a winning approach in a wide range of districts, rural and suburban and urban alike – why are certain national party leaders trying to control it?Voters divorced from party apparatchiks and DC groupthink would find it odd that Democratic party leaders are so wary of the people who are engaging most passionately with politics today. With Trump as president, income inequality swelling, and automation threatening to erode most of the blue-collar work that’s left, voters – especially those who self-identify as Democrats – understand exactly what’s at stake.They want leaders who can address their economic plight and precarity. When Trump ran for president, he proved that even the hardest of right voters have little interest in the gospel of neoliberalism that came out of the Reagan and Clinton administrations.Rightwing voters didn’t care that Trump had once spoken fondly of universal healthcare, ridiculed free-trade deals championed by party elders, and even mocked Jeb Bush’s support for the Iraq war. Trump is a fraud, a phony populist who has actually empowered the billionaire class, but it’s important to remember his campaign torched a Republican playbook peddled for generations.It’s important too to remember that conventional wisdom, especially that practiced by those in power, is often wrong, and that most rules of politics amount to little more than folklore invented by a professional class that would like to think they know better than they do.These were the same people, after all, who sneered at the idea of an avowed socialist from one of the tiniest states in America running a competitive presidential campaign.",Web Resources,2018,"person, policy, group, ideology","['progressives', 'not Trump']"

The Democratic Party, too, has a movement wing willing to abandon members of their own party they believe are insufficiently liberal.  “When it comes to Mary Landrieu, sticking with Big Oil is kind of the polar opposite of economic populism,” said Adam Green, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee’s co-founder.  The group, which says it represents the “Elizabeth Warren wing of American politics” and focuses on a message of economic populism, isn’t supporting Landrieu this cycle, even though it is backing other endangered Democrats like Mark Udall of Colorado, Bruce Braley of Iowa and Mark Begich of Alaska.

Both sides acknowledge that regardless of whether Romney, 70, runs this year for the seat held by retiring Sen. Orrin G.

Call it Revolution 2016 or another name that best speaks to base and message and its focused task over the next 5 months might be to mobilize voters under 30 (with likely positive impacts on Senate and Congressional races),” reads a copy of the draft proposal obtained by POLITICO.While Sanders will likely speak at July’s official Democratic convention in Philadelphia, the document proposes that he and his aides host a ‘convention’ event of their own to spur excitement and launch this group: “The best organized independent expenditure organization in history [that will] give the vast (and deeply anti-establishment) base a vehicle into which they will whole heartedly pour their energy.”Such an effort, they write, would help bridge the gap between Clinton and the “large cadre of young, newly political Sanders supporters [that] sees rejection of Hillary and the Democratic Party establishment as core to their identity.” If the group at first focused primarily on combating Trump, the thinking goes, it would provide those Sanders fans with justification for eventually voting for Clinton.“This is a populist year in American electoral politics with signs that it may mark the beginning of a populist era. It would be very unwise for the decidedly un-populist Hillary Clinton to move with too much confidence towards a full-on confrontation with Donald Trump,” they continue. “A Sanders-led (as opposed to Sanders-centered) independent entity could provide a much needed, articulate and energized economic populist voice to the anti-Trump effort without the intrinsic compromising effect posed by close association with Neoliberal Democratic elites, as well as weaning the volunteer base off total reliance on individual candidates during one-off election cycles.” The still-circulating proposal — by far the most advanced version of a post-primary discussion to surface — acknowledges that there are significant kinks still to work out in the post-primary plan, first and foremost how to fund the proposed independent entity.While Sanders has sustained his campaign with an online fundraising juggernaut, the pace of its donations has already slowed and it’s unlikely that he would be able to keep up a constant money flow beyond the campaign season. As a result, acknowledge the proposal drafters, he would be faced with the question of accepting big checks from individual donors — a direct contradiction with a central tenet of his current campaign.“Bernie Sanders may either believe that it is a principle, even outside of a candidacy, or feel that he is boxed in by the rhetoric of the campaign,” they write. “Controls could easily be applied — such as an open process governed by a diverse panel of volunteers who could accept or reject large donations, e.g. in excess of $10,000 — but in the end Bernie Sanders himself would have to decide where his priorities lie.""",Web Resources,2016,"person, group, ideology",['Sanders supporters']

And if Biden’s approach up to this point has been good enough to keep roughly 53% of the country solidly with him, it might not take a major political breakthrough — let alone a season of them — to reinforce that coalition by winning over just a small slice of doubters or critics. 
There are strategists in Biden’s coalition who hope to do considerably more than that, either by maneuvering the Democratic Party more decisively toward the political center or by competing more assertively with Republicans on themes of economic populism (or perhaps through some combination of the two).

Other Republican senators, like Roger Marshall of Kansas and Marco Rubio of Florida, have joined them in criticizing corporate labor practices or seeking to give workers more say on the job. 
These populist Senate Republicans are only the most visible portion of a larger movement. They have worked closely with a new generation of think tanks and intellectuals, who flesh out proposals for what a conservative economic populism might look like. That ecosystem has even come to include certain labor unions and other left-leaning groups that want to nurture a political coalition for reining in the free market.

Being a woman no doubt rubbed it in for some of the men, as the gender gap in the vote indicates. But Clinton's closing appeal of her competence vs.Trump's bad temperament, rather than a class-based economic appeal, only reinforced these perceptions of her as being on the other side. Where Greens Need to Go Hope for economic populist change was the common thread in white working- and middle-class people's votes for both Obama and Trump. It trumped their racism in the votes for Obama, and their racism excused Trump's racism in their vote for change in 2016. Greens should also engage the disgruntled Trump populists of the working class and middle class who voted for Trump as an outside change-agent promising economic relief and an end to elite insider arrogance and corruption, and who will be quickly disappointed as it becomes clear that Trump fails to deliver.

To this I’d add that the “cycle of compassionate conservatism” that Beinart identifies is a recurring phenomenon (see this fine Steve Teles essay on the subject) in part because there isn’t a permanent constituency within the G.O.P. for policies that are narrowly tailored to the interests of the poor, so you tend to have brief flurries of G.O.P. interest in those areas (often associated with a specific figure, from a Jack Kemp to a Michael Gerson) that then melt away when the political weather changes.",Web Resources,2014,"person, group, ideology",['not Republicans']

That the current economic arrangements don’t work for ordinary people has also prompted protests that don’t fit into a left framework. These included the gilets jaunes protests in France, the people who voted for Trump in the belief that he was an economic populist and the British voters who said yes to Brexit because they felt the system didn’t work for them.

2212925467,A ‘No Wing’ Author,11/21/2014,New York Times Company,"In the race for most eccentric contemporary author, whoever’s in second place probably can’t see Carolyn Chute. The writer, whose novel “Treat Us Like Dogs and We Will Become Wolves” is reviewed by Bill Roorbach this week, lives several turns off the beaten path in western Maine, where she founded the 2nd Maine Militia. In a 2008 profile of Chute in The Times, Charles McGrath described the group’s political philosophy as “essentially one of cheerful, nonpartisan economic populism.”
Chute has called the group part of a “no wing” militia movement that mingles with people on the right- and left-hand sides of the ideological spectrum. In a piece for the New Democracy Newsletter in 2000, she wrote: “Our goal is for citizens to feel like a sovereign power first before they take the big step of cutting the corporate jugular, of dismantling corporate power.” In the same piece, she described a favorite gun that “moves like a powerful but friendly little animal against the shoulder as you fire it.”
Ken Rosen, who taught Chute creative writing, once told The Washington Post: “She was writing about rural poor people, Maine people, from an angle I’d never seen before, looking up at them instead of looking down on them.”
Chute is as unclassifiable and unruly in her books as she is in person. Assessing the novel “The School on Heart’s Content Road” in the Book Review in 2008, Stacey D’Erasmo wrote: “Form doesn’t just follow feeling in these pages, it chases it helplessly with a butterfly net, casting about in multiple directions, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing. But watching Chute miss what she’s after is more interesting than watching a lesser, better behaved writer catch tidier prey.”

The Democrats have settled on economic populism as their unifying theme, not so much because that’s where all the passion is but because they can’t agree on any other agenda that would enlarge their coalition.

The proposed contract year 2026 policy and technical changes rule hit the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 20, before Donald Trump won the November presidential elections.The pending rule, which also includes Medicare Advantage, Medicare cost plan programs and PACE policies, is raising concerns it could be treated as a ""midnight"" rule allowing the Trump administration to insert its own policies before finalizing the rule.OMB's website says the rule will propose changes to strengthen and improve ""Part D provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act,"" using feedback from Part D sponsors, health care providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy groups and beneficiary advocates, and others. This includes ""regular listening sessions and other engagements to assist in the implementation of IRA provisions, gain input, identify areas that can be improved, and address vulnerabilities in the Part C and D programs,"" the abstract of the rule adds.Alex Azar, who led HHS from 2018 to 2021, said in a webinar in August that Trump might not want to dismantle CMS' drug price negotiation program if reelected and could seek to please economic populists in the Republican Party by building on the program and out-negotiating the Biden administration by seeking to get even lower drug prices. Azar had said Trump might ""try to out-IRA the Biden-Harris administration on negotiating"" if elected to a second term.""You know, I think it would be a point of pride if he could get better deals than they got,"" Azar said.Trump would likely be supportive of technical fixes to the IRA, he said, but ""I think if drug companies are hoping that a Republican takeover of the executive leads to IRA drug negotiation going away, I'm very doubtful of that ... They're big enterprises, and there's a significant part of this new populist wing of the Republican Party that is not going to carry pharma's water for it the way the older Republican Party would on free market.""The IRA passed in 2022 without a single Republican vote.

The lesson is mass movements need to build their own party. The movement should not be distracted by the media and bi-partisan politicos who urge us to vote against what is necessary for the people and planet. At this time of crisis, we cannot settle for false non-solutions. Howie Hawkins, one of the founders of the Green Party and the first candidate to campaign on a Green New Deal, describes, in From The Bottom Up: The Case For An Independent Left Party, how Trumpism is weakening as its rhetoric of economic populism has turned into extreme reactionary Republicanism for the millionaires and billionaires. He explains that Democrats are not the answer either, as “they won’t replace austerity capitalism and militaristic imperialism to which the Democratic Party is committed.”
The result, writes Hawkins, is we must commit ourselves “to build an independent, membership-based working-class party.” Even the New Deal-type reforms of Bernie Sanders “do not end the oppression, alienation, and disempowerment of working people” and do not stop “capitalism’s competitive drive for mindless growth that is devouring the environment and roasting the planet.”
Hawkins urges an ecosocialist party that creates economic democracy; i.e., social ownership of the means of production for democratic planning and allocation of economic surpluses as well as confronting the climate crisis. He explains socialism is a “movement of the working class acting for itself, independently, for its own freedom.”

Ryan, another GOP vice-presidential nominee known for his free-market orthodoxy.“It’s clear to most leaders of the party that the future will be the Vances, the Hawleys and the Rubios - to have one of them be on the ticket is a very significant marker, or in some ways validation, of the direction the Republican Party is now heading on key economic issues,” said Oren Cass, a Vance ally and president of American Compass, a think tank closely tied to the economic populists in the GOP. “Vance articulates a very clear perspective on the failure of what he’ll call the ‘market fundamentalism’ of the GOP - the consensus economic policy of the last few decades.”Vance’s predecessor, former senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), was also viewed as closely allied with the party’s traditional GOP policymakers.“The emergence of Trump has caused a populist, aggressive side of the GOP to split off on economics, and Vance is one of the leaders of that populist caucus,” said Brian Riedl, who served as an aide to Portman and is now at the Manhattan Institute, a center-right think tank. “Trump is much more economically populist, anti-free trade than traditional Republicans, and Vance has pushed hard to support this new populist economics in the GOP.”Vance’s rise has rankled some GOP elites: Many top party donors opposed the pick, including Kenneth C.

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein announced her vice presidential choice on Wednesday, naming Cheri Honkala, an anti-poverty advocate from Philadelphia and national coordinator for the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign. 

""My running mate has been on the front lines fighting for the American poor, taking on the banks, taking on foreclosures, standing up for children most at risk,"" Ms. Stein said. 

Ms. Stein also said that her party, running heavily on environmental and economic populist themes, would compete nationally and take their message to the American people. 

At an event at the National Press Club in Washington, Ms. Stein laid out her campaign platform, heavily emphasizing what she called ""the Green New Deal"" of economic justice and jobs for all Americans who want them, tough financial regulation, political reform to reduce the role of money in politics, and a transition to a ""green"" economy. 

Ms. Stein and her campaign manager, Ben Manski, said the Green Party will be on the presidential ballot in more than 40 states and this week filed for matching funds from the Federal Election Commission.

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

As progressives, we stand united in the belief that a woman's autonomy over her own body is not a secondary issue or a ""social issue,"" but rather a human right and a necessity in order to attain and preserve economic security in her life. As progressives, we acknowledge that the current economic system is exceptionally punishing of mothers, single mothers, and mothers of color whose wages, job opportunities, and economic advancement suffer due to the ""motherhood penalty.""
As progressives, we stand united in our belief that 21st century economic populism must include an understanding of how race and gender affect our economic reality and our economic opportunity. As a progressive movement, we recognize that over the last decade there has been a massive erosion of access to abortion and attacks on contraception and we cannot back away from this fight without abandoning people and undercutting core constituencies in our base.

gridlock will likely impede the most ambitious scal stimulus measures from being enacted (see '2016 Election Scenarios: Pendulum To Swing To The Democrats', August 11). As such, we forecast only a modest widening of the scal decit as a percentage of GDP to 3.4% in 2017 and 3.3% in 2018, from an estimated 3.1% in 2016 and below consensus expectations. 

 Case For Fiscal Expansion Will Strengthen


The rise of economic populism, as exemplied by support for Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders' strong challenge to Clinton in the Democratic primaries, has largely come as a surprise to the US political establishment, and will see lawmakers become more agreeable towards scal expansion. The core of Trump's support is the white working class, a segment of the US population that has felt alienated by both political parties over the last two decades as trade liberalisation has decimated regional industrial bases, while the 2011 Budget Sequestration Act capped discretionary spending on education, infrastructure and funds going to programmes aimed at helping those most dislocated

But Harris, too, was doing some cleanup. Each supports ending employer-based health insurance in favor of Medicare for all.

Tammy Baldwin, a Madison progressive, won 17 ""Trump counties"" in Wisconsin and lost non-college whites statewide by only five points after running a campaign that combined economic populism, parochial Wisconsin themes, health care advocacy and heavy outreach outside Madison and Milwaukee. In addition to being political platforms for the parties, conventions are also used by the  media to tell political stories and shape political narratives. A Wisconsin convention will conjure up a different blend of political themes and stories than a Texas or Florida convention would have.

David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the key to threading the electoral needle in 2020 was a diverse presidential ticket able to stop the hemorrhaging of white rural voters and to excite minority voters. He pointed to Senator Sherrod Brown’s success in Ohio in appealing to both electorates in his 2018 re-election in a state that otherwise voted for Republicans in statewide campaigns. “If between the ticket you have someone who’s got that economic populist brand of a Sherrod Brown, but also the diversity that will energize Cuyahoga County so that you have a margin of 200,000-plus versus 150,000, I think you win Ohio and all the rest of those Midwest states,” Mr. Pepper said. He was referring to the Democrat-rich county dominated by the predominantly black city of Cleveland. (To be sure, Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016.)

Economic populism is the hardy perennial recommendation of liberal pollsters and labor-union political directors. It keeps coming back, even though election results have never quite borne it out. Deeply invested in the individualistic ""American dream,"" and deeply divided by race, ethnicity and religion, Americans have proven less susceptible to class-based economic appeals than voters in other nations.

At the end of the keynote address members of the audience were given the opportunity to ask questions. Lorretta Ross, co-founder and national coordinator of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, asked Gay to speak about the “white tribalism” of the left, and how white liberals have thrown out discussion of identity politics to focus on the economic anxiety. “White people on the left, especially those who are into politics, are using identity politics as an offering and say ‘Hey, we’re going to blame identity politics and get on board with Bernie Sanders and economic populism, so that we can get forward, and then we’ll come back to you,’” Gay said. According to Gay, the biggest disservice to people of color and marginalized groups is the phrase “identity politics.”
“It allows people to dismiss really important issues, and that people are so willing on the left to know better and to be better to throw queer people, people of color, working class people…[anyone] not white under the bus just shows so that white tribalism supersedes all.”

2037915866,Delusions of Kanye,5/13/2018,New York Times Company,"Indeed, a striking irony of this era is that the potential common ground has arguably increased.The sociological transformation of the Republican Party into a working-class party means that its base has more in common economically with the average black American than the country-club G.O.P. of yore. The secularization of American society means that the religious right and the churchgoing African-American community share a metaphysical worldview that's faded elsewhere in our spiritual-but-less-religious nation. And the economic populism and foreign-policy anti-interventionism of Trumpism -- well, at least campaign-season Trumpism -- were closer to common African-American views than the typical Republican agenda.So black America and conservatism have converged in interesting ways -- but in the most important way they are inevitably divided, for the obvious reason that Donald Trump's ascent began with a racist conspiracy theory and then added other white-identitarian appeals.It is a liberal mistake to think that bigotry suffices to explain the Trump phenomenon. But it is a conservative error, naïve or culpably ignorant, to act disappointed that black Americans aren't attracted to a coalition led by a barely-repentant ""birther"" who flirts with white supremacists.For decades, the essential failure of conservative outreach to African-Americans has been the insistence that the right just want to treat black Americans as individuals -- a fine-sounding idea, except that white America has never found a way to treat its former slaves that way, making black identity politics not an indulgence but a matter of survival.To this failure Trump has added an exclamation point. He has been shrewder than libertarian conservatives in recognizing that individualism is not enough, that the right needs a politics of solidarity.

French and German elections. One unifying point in each of these elections is the rise of economic populism, with sluggish economic growth and rising inequality stoking anti-establishment movements. Thus far, however, populism has yet to translate into signicant shifts in economic policy. There has been a shift in the discourse away from expansive but increasingly limited monetary policy easing and towards scal expansion.

2042683875,Democrats divide on Bernie’s 2020 plans,5/16/2017,POLITICO LLC,"If that’s what they’re looking to do, I guess that they would consider it a disaster. If they want to win the White House, I think it would be a good thing,” Weaver said.That's a similar message to the one Weaver delivered to a private caucus meeting of Senate Democrats early this year, when he warned those up for re-election in 2018 against centrism, raising eyebrows in the room, according to Democrats present for the presentation.But at a time other — and far less famous — potential 2020 contenders are speaking with operatives about what their campaigns might look like and gathering allies by raising money for colleagues, Sanders' push is far more oriented toward defining Democrats' message in public. In Congress, a number of up-and-comers say they’re glad to see Sanders pushing the party toward an economic focus, and away from the social issues of Hillary Clinton’s failed “Stronger Together.” Those voices, and the people who show up by the thousands still at Sanders’ stops around the country, are the ones the gripers should be focused on, his supporters say — not nursing old grudges or complaining that Sanders would torpedo their chances.Starting with healthcare-focused rallies in January that he encouraged Senate Democratic leaders to do more widely, Sanders continues traveling the country. He’s also using his newfound celebrity to elevate local-level fights like a unionization drive in Mississippi and the candidacy of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Tom Perriello, whose effort is being managed by one of his former top staffers.Touring the country with Perez, Sanders sought to stamp his economic populism on the head of the DNC. But people familiar with the arrangement said he also spent much of the time traveling with the party chair on their private Gulfstream jet getting to learn about Perez’s personal history, which he hadn't bothered to read up on earlier.“For years, our fellow activists on the left have said we need an antidote to the tea party.

""As we saw in Donald Trump’s speech last night, Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year,” Taylor said. “Clinton should push the White House to take TPP off the table in a lame duck Congress in order to avoid this vice presidential pick allowing Donald Trump to outflank her on this key issue."" According to a report in the Huffington Post, Kaine has told Clinton he now opposes the TPP, though he praised the agreement as recently as Thursday.The PCCC's criticism comes after another progressive group, Democracy for America, denounced Kaine in a pre-emptive strike issued before Clinton even announced her pick.“It should be disqualifying for any potential Democratic vice presidential candidate to be part of a lobbyist-driven effort to help banks dodge consumer protection standards and regulations designed to prevent banks from destroying our economy,” the group’s executive director Charles Chamberlain said in a statement Thursday, referencing a letter Kaine signed urging the Federal Reserve to consider easing regulations on regional banks.

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right.

And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action.

The wine track candidates have drawn support primarily from well-educated, financially comfortable white voters, many of whom identify as independents rather than partisan Democrats, who are liberal on social and foreign policy issues but generally less focused on economic concerns. Beer track candidates have relied mostly on blue-collar whites and African Americans, more open to lunch-bucket economic appeals and moderate to conservative positions on cultural and national security issues. Not all presidential primaries divided the party along these lines, but when they did, the beer track candidate almost always beat the contender from the wine track. In 1984, beer-track candidate Mondale, the favorite of organized labor, beat ""Atari Democrat"" Hart, the champion of ""new ideas."" In 1992, Bill Clinton, with a message that married economic populism with the notion of personal responsibility in social policy, amassed strong margins among blue-collar whites and African Americans to beat Tsongas and Brown, each of whom had considerable appeal to upscale white liberals. In 2000, Gore used a similar coalition to easily turn aside the challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley, who also ran well among wine-track voters.

Indeed, even after the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression - one inarguably caused by Wall Street greed - Democrats resisted the impulse to engage in the sort of anti-business populism that many believed was not only smart politically but actually quite appropriate. 

Rather, Democrats were happy to parrot the Republican party's talk about deficit spending and defer discussions of income inequality. The gutlessness of Democrats reached its pinnacle in the autumn of 2010 when a mere two months before midterm elections congressional Democrats refused to bring to a vote a measure that would have brought to an end tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year. 

That Democrats are now willing to let their economic populist flag fly is long overdue, but it's the result less of an infusion of political courage and more from a spectacular piece of political incompetence from Republicans. 

Go back to the debt limit debacle of last summer. Republicans were insistent on using the generally pro forma process of extending the debt limit as an opportunity to force the president's hand on massive spending cuts. But Obama came back at them with a highly effective compromise that was the equivalent of political kryptonite for Republicans: ""I'll see your spending cuts even to the entitlement programmes that my party has long championed, but in return you need to raise taxes - just a little.""

College-educated Republican parents, for example, would especially like to see elected officials focusing on more issues like promoting the so-called success sequence (that is, earn at least a high school diploma, get a job and then marry before having any children) to high schoolers, enforcing the paying of child support and keeping kids from getting access to pornography online.Republican parents without a college diploma support those ideas, too. But they are much more likely to support actual spending for families -- a full child tax credit to every family with a worker present, assistance in paying for child care, social spending on pregnant mothers and elimination of tax code provisions and safety net policies that are more generous to couples who live together than those who marry. And as the parties increasingly sort along educational lines, parents without college degrees are the engine of today's Republican Party.A pro-family agenda coupled with cultural and economic populism also has appeal to liberals. For example, over 80 percent of Republican and Democratic parents agreed that it is both ""too easy for kids to find explicit content online"" and that tech companies should be required to obtain parents' permission before allowing minors to create a social media account.The research suggests an agenda that seeks to make it easier for couples to marry would garner support from most parents, not just conservatives. Among Republican parents, as well as Democratic parents without a college degree, a majority thought the government should do more to promote marriage. By contrast, college-educated Democratic parents were least likely to state a preference for policies that promoted marriage and the most likely to say they saw the institution as ""outdated.""So a political movement that championed marriage on the level of both language and concrete policy would appeal to the bulk of parents while also highlighting where the college-educated Democrats' preferences diverge from the mainstream.Pro-family policies could, however, err too far in the other direction.",Newspapers,2023,"policy, group, ideology",[]

Churchgoing Trump voters were still more culturally conservative than Clinton voters - more likely to support the death penalty, more skeptical of immigration - and their views of Muslims, interestingly, seemed to have been influenced by Trump's own rhetoric, becoming more hostile between 2016 and 2017. But in general, churchgoing Republicans look more like the party many elite conservatives wanted to believe existed before Trump came along - more racially tolerant, more accepting of multiculturalism and globalization, and also more consistently libertarian on economics. Secularized Trump voters look more like the party as Trump has tried to remake it, blending an inchoate economic populism with strong racial resentments. Interestingly in the survey the different groups make about the same amount of money, which cuts against strict economic-anxiety explanations for Trumpism. But the churchgoers and nonchurchgoers differ more in social capital: The irreligious are less likely to have college degrees, less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced; they're also less civically engaged, less satisfied with their neighborhoods and communities, and less trusting and optimistic in general. This seems to support the argument, advanced by Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner among others, that support for populism correlates with a kind of communal breakdown, in which secularization is one variable among many leaving people feeling isolated and angry, and drawing them to the ersatz solidarity of white identity politics.",Newspapers,2018,"group, ideology",['secularized Trump voters']

""They work in the oilfields and they hear they are racist, and they just got tired of it being slammed in their face.""He added, ""Tell your editors that they need to run a headline that says 'Main Street Won.'""And yet, in the weeks since Trump's surprise election, Wall Street has been winning, too.The stocks of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years - a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise.The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo's share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in September.For now, banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the president-elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the industry, including the fees banks can charge, whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold.Banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a Trump administration's fiscal stimulus program revives inflation. Higher rates would increase the value of some of the banks' holdings and would widen banks' margins on loans.But like nearly all of Trump's policy positions, his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail.Trump's feelings on banks, perhaps more so than other industries, are difficult to sort out.On one hand, he has called for dismantling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits. On the other, he has railed against Wall Street elites for keeping down small-town America.How, then, will Trump justify policies that bolster bank profits, while also delivering on his promises of economic populism?Community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot. They say Trump can limit regulations - particularly on banks with less than $10 billion in assets - while still being tough on the Wall Street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public.Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural America Trump championed in his campaign.Among community bankers, support for Trump has been pervasive and consistent.Roughly 84 per cent of community bankers supported Trump, according to a poll that the industry's trade group conducted after the political conventions this summer.""I didn't have any Trump signs in my yard,"" said Tim Zimmerman, president of Standard Bank, which operates in communities outside Pittsburgh. ""But I want the bank to do well and to be able to help people in the community.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

Economic populism has likewise ascended on the left-best represented by US Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns-and recent years have brought together strange cross-partisan bedfellows on issues of trade, labor, and industrial policy.

In addition to hearing from Americans who will be impacted directly, Clinton’s team has consulted widely on student debt, including with the staff for the progressive Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.“There’s something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills they need in order to make the best of their own lives,” Clinton told an audience at an Iowa community college in April, as her campaign was just beginning.In the months since, however, progressive outsiders have successfully pushed – or at least nudged – Clinton to the left.Many groups had expressed hopes that Clinton would roll out a proposal for entirely debt-free college – not just tuition-free – such as the sweeping plans already proposed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley.Clinton’s plan still expects families to cover part of their tuition costs – through savings or loans. Under her plan, military veterans, lower-income students and 250,000 members of programs like AmeriCorps would attend college tuition-free.Other parents would still have to cover part of the costs for their children’s schooling.Even though it did not go as far as they hoped, leading debt-free groups lauded Clinton’s detailed proposal as contributing to a groundswell of support for an issue long ignored by the Washington mainstream.“Hillary Clinton’s plan is very big and ambitious – leading to debt-free college and increased economic opportunity for millions of Americans,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “The center of gravity on higher education has shifted from tinkering with interest rates to making college debt-free – and Clinton’s bold proposal is emblematic of the rising economic populist tide in American politics.”StrikeDebt, the Occupy movement’s offshoot which has forgiven millions in student debt, was less forgiving: “Hillary Clinton’s plan on student debt is designed to win votes and never become law,” the group tweeted after details of Clinton’s proposal leaked on Sunday. “It’s bait and nothing more. Don’t take the bait.”In May, Sanders introduced a Senate bill that would eliminate tuition at four-year public colleges and universities, which is estimated to cost $70bn a year. Two-thirds of the cost would be covered by the federal government and one-third would be covered by the states, according to the Sanders campaign.O’Malley has come out in favor of striking down student debts and has told his supporters that “every student should be able to go to college debt-free”.",Web Resources,2015,"person, policy, group, ideology","['progressives', 'StrikeDebt', 'Occupy movement']"

The race marked the third highly-contested, fair-fight special House election that the GOP has dropped in the last year.  The seat Murtha held for 36 years is precisely the sort of Rust Belt district—economically populist and culturally traditional—that Republicans must win to claim the 40 seats necessary to take back the House.

His campaign believes the Democratic Party risks narrowing its Electoral College path in 2020, and hurting its standing on Capitol Hill, if candidates do not appeal directly to these more moderate voters in battleground states in the Midwest and Sun Belt.And both explicitly and more subtly, Mr. Biden is portraying his chief rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and another top candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, as liberals who are overly focused on expensive and theoretical government overhauls.""Growing up in a middle-class neighborhood, the last thing I liked is people telling my family and me what we should know, what we should believe,"" Mr. Biden said as he criticized Ms. Warren's advocacy style, speaking at a recent CNN town hall in Iowa.

2139670942,Interview: Sean McElwee aka 'we’re going to abolish ICE',11/30/2018,"Uloop, Inc.","always psyched when new folks stop by my happy hour pic.twitter.com/zWl4MmfNdF
— we're going to abolish ICE (@SeanMcElwee) August 10, 2018

McElwee described Abolish ICE as a “rallying cry” and “organizing principle,” stressing that it’s about “giving a left wing to immigration debates in the United States, which have been thoroughly and fully defined within right-wing frameworks.”

He also said the movement puts pressure on liberals to move beyond standard paradigms for describing mass deportation—for instance, the Obama administration’s “Felons, not Families” policy, which, he observed, “is a really dumb framework, because many felons have families.”

The movement is currently focused on “disentangling” ICE from local policing and law enforcement and, more broadly, creating cultural norms against mass deportation. 
Identity politics 

Refuting critics of “tribalism,” who suggest that too much focus on diversity markers like race and gender leads to political fragmentation rather than coalition-building, McElwee maintains that “identity politics” remain an important tool for mobilizing class-conscious leftism. 
“Supporting women of color nine times out of ten means that you’re supporting the progressive candidate,” McElwee said, citing as examples Congresswomen-elect Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, and Deb Haaland. “The Republican caucus is not made up of centrist black businesswomen.”

Countering the “Bernie Bro” narrative, which suggests support for leftists is strongest among educated whites, McElwee insisted that “descriptive representation”—voting for candidates with diverse identities—is both an important aim in itself and a good heuristic for worker-friendly economic populism. 
“If you actually look at who in the Democratic base is most ready for socialism—most ready for super anticapitalist politics—it’s not rural non-college whites,” he said. 
The labor left & worker solidarity 

McElwee said he views arguments on the “labor left”—such as the claim that immigrants consume social services that could otherwise flow to American workers—as a kind of exclusionary “labor chauvinism,” focusing only on workers with documentation. 
McElwee argued that those on the labor left should support all workers, including “those that are both victims of capitalism and white supremacy at the same time.” He pointed out that ICE has partnered with private industry and “has been increasingly weaponized as a force of capital.”

Referring to legal disputes between the 7-Eleven corporation and franchisees, McElwee said the convenience store chain “basically use[s] ICE as a bludgeon in contract negotiations with small business owners.”

American immigration policy, he claimed, was “designed to create this underclass of people with no legal rights.” ICE’s mission, he said, is a direct consequence of that policy; he said that ICE “has been increasingly weaponized as a force of capital.”

Wall Street


Nowhere is the shift within the Democratic Party since Clinton's first run in 2008 more apparent than in the candidates' stances on Wall Street. 

Part of the difference is the lingering resentment over the 2008 financial crisis and bailouts of big banks. Much of it also is the influence of Warren, who, since becoming a Massachusetts senator, has led liberal revolts against Republicans and the Obama White House over Wall Street issues. 

Sanders has long embraced a straightforward approach to big banks: He would break them apart.",Newspapers,2016,"person,policy,group,ideology","['progressives', 'Democrats']"

If the organization's leader spends part of his time opposing the president's agenda in a land much like our own, there's nothing the members can do about it. The other disquieting aspect of Messina's misalliance is that it reflects an emerging set of political beliefs among some younger Democratic Party leaders who have grown close to Wall Street, Silicon Valley or both - as Messina did while bringing both big money and technological wizardry to Obama's reelection campaign. This umpteenth iteration of the New Democrats believes in such socially liberal causes as gay marriage but is skeptical of unions and appalled at economic populism. At times, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel exemplifies this breed of Democrat, but the group's true poster child is Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who defended Wall Street during the 2012 controversy over Bain Capital's plant closings (""stop attacking private equity,"" he said on ""Meet The Press"") and who has actually had a high-tech start-up personally bestowed on him by his Silicon Valley fans. For Democrats such as these, Cameron's Tories, in their support for gay marriage, their opposition to labor (and Labor) and their defense of big banks against the European Union's efforts to regulate them, may look surprisingly simpatico.

No one has suffered more as a result of the economic reality than blacks, Latinos and other minorities, but Sanders' support among them has lagged up till now, partly because he's still unknown to them, and partly because minorities experience racial injustice more clearly, urgently and acutely than they do economic injustice.

The proposed contract year 2026 policy and technical changes rule hit the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 20, before Donald Trump won the November presidential elections.The pending rule, which also includes Medicare Advantage, Medicare cost plan programs and PACE policies, is raising concerns it could be treated as a ""midnight"" rule allowing the Trump administration to insert its own policies before finalizing the rule.OMB's website says the rule will propose changes to strengthen and improve ""Part D provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act,"" using feedback from Part D sponsors, health care providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy groups and beneficiary advocates, and others.

If signed, the executive action would call for a review of foreign trading practices and could, depending on the results, be followed retaliatory trade measures from the administration. 
The action would additionally reflect a tension within the White House between the economic populists, who have argued for more aggressive and adversarial moves against foreign countries, and the growing influence of pragmatists, who have called for a more measured approach. 
During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked others countries over their trade practices, arguing other countries were contributing to the US trade deficit - the gap between the cost of a country's imports and its exports - by using subsidies and other practices to undercut US firms and lure away jobs. 
Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

But the stakes for corporate power are uniquely multifaceted. It’s one of the rare policy areas where a baseline consensus has emerged, in large part because of a massive political shift since the 2008 financial crisis.On both the left and right, populist factions are battling it out with a more corporatist political establishment for the soul of their respective parties.

Kamala Harris, on the other hand, resisted articulating a full policy vision until early September, when her campaign finally launched an issues page on her website. The economic platform gestures at giving new powers to antitrust enforcers under the overall framing of going after “bad actors,” a vague designation that leaves a lot of questions up to interpretation.Despite Harris’s coy attitude toward policy, the political incentives are more aligned in the Democratic coalition for her to inherit the strongest administration on corporate power in decades, and give them four more years.BASED ON RECENT POLLING, A MAJORITY OF VOTERS blame corporate price-gouging for inflation and support breaking up monopolies as a tool against it.

In terms of policy, Clinton has been focusing on an economic populist pitch with a strong appeal to women, highlighting equal pay, paid family leave, affordable child care and universal pre-K — and trying to highlight a contrast on those issues with the Republican field. The outside groups supporting her bid are expected to spend the money defining the contrast between Clinton’s record on women’s issues and those of her Republican opponents.  “The entire Republican field is a case study in extremism, and we must fight back against their agenda that would marginalize opportunities for women of every race, age, and economic background,” Guy Cecil, co-chair of Priorities USA, said in a statement.

Trump's political cunning made him identify a hidden trend for liberal elites who ruled the fates of both parties. He realized that deep in the United States – especially in the countryside, small towns, and post-industrial areas coming within the ""rust belt""—lives a cultural group long ignored by cosmopolitan biempensants. To this postponed segment he offered a mixture of social conservatism with economic populism. The successful formula revolutionized American politics, to the point that today the Republican Party is preferred by the working class and has moved away from the professional sectors that previously constituted its electorate.These are now approaching a Democratic Party increasingly divided between a progressive and a socialist soul, whose confrontation has been momentarily delayed in the wake of his common contempt for Trump. Better yet, the President made significant progress between the black and Latino electorate. This confirms that he found a cultural key that breaks with the ""identity tribes"" that Democrats once considered their automatic passage to victory.The strength of the President-inspired political-electoral movement, its full control of the Republican Party and the passionate adherence it arouses among its supporters,constitute foundations on which he will no doubt continue to work.",Newspapers,2020,"group, ideology",['working class']

Third Way's resulting document warns that key voters believe Democrats prioritize poor citizens, and some rich ones — but not the middle class.

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

When then-House Speaker Paul Ryan was in charge, the GOP squandered a historic opportunity to build the wall and secure the border, instead using their political capital to force controversial votes on a laundry list of policies favored by the old Republican establishment that had little to do with the America First agenda. Against all odds, Trump is giving Republicans one last chance to save themselves from being relegated to permanent minority status, and to save the nation from permanent transformation into a polyglot cacophony of warring tribes and divisive identity politics. If they play their cards right, Republicans could become the party of a new, broad American middle class that includes traditionally Democratic voters who rally around the president's America First economic populism. But if they revert to the old pre-Trump GOP playbook, they will be consigned to the dustheap of history, in an America split between a vanishing middle class and a permanent Democratic majority of ruling class elites and foreign-born serfs. With all the positive economic news promising to buoy support for Trump and the Republicans next November, the GOP has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the political landscape in 2020.

Perhaps most notably, Biden successfully lobbied last year for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which represented the US’s most significant legislative response yet to the climate crisis. His efforts to cancel some student loan debt have also won praise from progressives, although that executive order has faced legal challenges.Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he still considers Biden’s most recent policy decisions to be “exceptions” rather than the rule of his governing philosophy. Pointing to Biden’s State of the Union address in February, Green said the president still appears committed to economic populist proposals like affordable healthcare and paid family leave.Casting our needs aside to appeal to a smaller faction of centrist voters is pretty foolishMichele Weindling of the Sunrise MovementHowever, Green added, Biden’s potential pivot to the political center could create an optics problem for the 2024 election if Trump wins the Republican nomination and “absurdly tries to claim the mantle of economic populism”.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

In the data, you can see in stark relief how Flake is politically marooned.According to Pew, the Republican coalition is largely made up for four typologies: Core Conservatives, Country First Conservatives, Market Skeptic Republicans and New Era Enterprisers.Flake is best categorized as a New Era Enterpriser, defined by Pew as “fundamentally optimistic about the state of the nation and its future … strongly pro-business and generally think[ing] that immigrants strengthen, rather than burden, the country.” More than any other faction of Republicans, New Era Enterprisers shun economic populism; a strong majority believes “U.S. involvement in the global economy is a good thing” and a slight majority says, “banks and other financial institutions have a positive effect on the country.” New Era Enterprisers also show some flickering signs of social liberalism.

I am Catholic and have much sympathy with critiques of modern liberalism, but if you think America is ready for some kind of Habsburg Restoration, you are definitely best placed of all to miss the opportunity conservatism faces.

This new book explains.,5/25/2016,WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post,"The reaction of Democrats, ironically, was to largely embrace his positions on foreign policy, civil rights, gender issues, social issues like abortion and the death penalty, and process issues like campaign finance reform. But on economic issues there was a sense among Democrats that the party had been burned by Johnson's Great Society. There was also lingering resentment toward labor for its support of the Vietnam War and its hostility toward Democratic reformers. So as a result, Democrats, particularly in Congress, moved away from the kind of economic liberalism, even economic populism that had defined the party for decades. I think this helped Republicans appeal to voters on economic issues. The Sanders phenomenon is in some ways a reaction to this move away from economic liberalism -- with the accompanying embrace of international trade and so-called ""neoliberal"" solutions to policy challenges. Sanders has a lot of support among white liberals, but he's also done quite well among working-class white voters, who I think view the Democratic Party as too close to Wall Street, too focused on international trade and not interested enough in their challenges.",Web Resources,2016,"person, ideology, group","['Democrats', 'working-class white voters']"

A hard-right plutocrat is the most powerful man on Earth: a man who calls white supremacists “very fine people”, who demanded a total ban on Muslims entering the US, who separated crying children from their parents and locked them in cages, and has adopted far-right tropes about Europe “losing its culture” because of immigration. His elevation to the presidency was deemed a laughable impossibility: the Clinton camp reacted with “giddy disbelief” when he became the Republican frontrunner in early 2016.Yes, Clinton suffered misogyny, and Russia undoubtedly preferred Trump and acted on it: yet the latter factor has become a Clintonian comfort blanket, a means to avoid a post mortem on the politics of the Democratic failure. As veteran Democratic Representative Barbara Lee told me just after Donald Trump’s “American carnage” inauguration speech, there was no shortage of political mobilisation against Trump in the US election: “What I didn’t see in there was the clarity of what our platform was.” Indeed, as a prominent US progressive campaigner, Ben Wikler, put it: “If you ask people what Hillary Clinton’s platform was, they couldn’t tell you … If you asked people what Donald Trump’s platform was, everyone could tell you.”A Democratic campaign founded on economic populism could have defeated Trump, but Clinton did not believe in it, and was beholden to vested economic interests who would have suffered because of it.A leftwing insurgency is undoubtedly making inroads against the Democratic party establishment. The triumph of a 28-year-old socialist, Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez – who defeated a party establishment kingpin, Joe Crowley, in a New York primary – was one striking example, and self-declared socialists have won from Virginia to Pennsylvania.

The DNC’s “unity reform commission”, which was established to heal the divide between supporters of Clinton and Sanders, is still wrangling over the role of superdelegates in the party’s primary system.And in New York, tensions flared when the DNC chair, Tom Perez, intervened in the gubernatorial race to endorse Governor Andrew Cuomo against the insurgent candidate – the actor and progressive favorite Cynthia Nixon.During a live interview with the Washington Post this week, Sanders said Perez’s endorsement of Cuomo was “absolutely” a mistake and “not what the DNC chair should be doing”.Democratic party officials have intervened in certain congressional races to help the candidate they believe has the best chance of winning the general election succeed in a crowded primary contest. The strategy, which drew progressive backlash in Texas, paid off this week in California, where a glut of candidates threatened to split the share of Democratic voters and produce all-Republican ballots in November under the state’s “jungle primary” system.In order to win back the House, the Democratic party must be willing to intervene in primary races as it did in California, says Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institutution and member of the DNC.“The path to a Democratic majority does not run through deep blue districts. The path runs through purple and slightly red districts,” Kamarck said, adding: “The irony here is that the party must win in places where the progressive message doesn’t work as well in order to get close to a place where you can have a progressive agenda.”The tug of the party’s progressive wing didn’t begin with Sanders’s entrance into the 2016 presidential race.But Stephanie Taylor, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, credits him with helping to bring the left’s economic populist agenda into the mainstream.Ideas like a European-style healthcare system, once dismissed as magical thinking, now has the support of more than half of House Democratic lawmakers and one-third of the Senate caucus.“That the question around healthcare is no longer ‘Should we fix the Affordable Care Act?’ but ‘What is the best way to get to universal healthcare?’ is a radical departure from where we were,” Taylor said.According to an analysis by Brookings, 42% of non-incumbent Democratic candidates label themselves progressives, compared with just 14% in 2014 and 13% in 2016.Among them is Eastman. She faces an uphill battle to oust the Republican incumbent, Don Bacon, in the conservative-leaning district. “I’m running because I feel a sense of desperation in the country and I think a lot of people feel similarly,” Eastman said.“And,” she added, “we learned from 2016 that people are willing to take a bet on political outsiders.”Lauren Gambino in Washington@laurenegambino",Web Resources,2018,"person, group, ideology","['Progressive Change Campaign Committee', 'progressives']"

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

2251627147,What Each Side Won Yesterday,11/7/2018,Newstex,"The Republican electorate isn’t expanding categorically (getting a group to switch allegiances) or chronologically (they carried voters 45 and older by one point, 50 percent to 49 percent, while losing voters under 45 by a 36 percent to 64 percent margin), but the Trumpified Republicans have managed to get high levels of turnout from older, disproportionately rural white voters by stoking their fears of immigrants and their resentments at more diverse and liberal America that appears to be passing them by. On economic issues, even conservative voters in the most Republican states are relatively progressive. Voters in Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah passed ballot measures yesterday that expanded Medicaid eligibility, while voters in Arkansas and Missouri passed measures raising their state minimum wage. But a critical mass of those voters also voted for right-wing Republicans, because however much they may support rudimentary forms of economic populism, it isn’t a defining issue for them. Affirming their more traditional culture (which in many cases, of course, is a euphemism for racism, sexism, and Lord knows what else) is the determining factor in their choice of candidates. In a sense, the central messages of both parties worked yesterday. In the exit polls, 41 percent of Americans said that health care was the issue that mattered to them most, and they gave 75 percent of their votes to the Democrats.",Web Resources,2018,"group, policy, ideology",['Democrats']
758852218,Suburban Diversity and Economic Inequality: Can the Democrats Meet the Challenge?,10/1/2010,University of Pennsylvania Press,"But the hype over the GOP's success in mobilizing ""family values"" voters in the white exurbs obscured more than it revealed about contemporary suburban politics writ large. The most rapidly growing exurbs still contain only a small percentage of the total suburban electorate, which is dominated by high-density inner suburbs and diversifying middle-ring suburbs. Although the Republican Party controlled the suburban vote during the 1980s, partisan allegiance in the suburbs actually has been almost evenly divided since Bill Clinton targeted the ""forgotten middle class"" during the recessionshaped election of 1992. Clinton's victory revealed that economic populism could win back Reagan Democrats in the working-class suburbs, especially during hard times, and the party has also appealed to middle-class moderates alienated by the GOP's culture-war agenda. But more than anything else, the inroads the Democrats have made reflect the increasing racial and economic diversity of American suburbia, now home to a majority of each racial and ethnic minority group within large metropolitan areas. In addition, more poor people today live in suburbs than in the central cities, and a preponderance of suburban households no longer conform to the traditional nuclear family ideal. The suburbs of the 100 largest metropolitan regions, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, now include 78 percent of white residents, 62 percent of Asian Americans/Asian immigrants, 59 percent of Latinos, and just over half of all African Americans (up from 43 percent in 2000).",Magazines,2010,"group, ideology",['Democrats']

Yet there is an economic element to political extremism, just not what you’d think. Right-wing extremists, and to some extent even more mainstream conservative media, rely on financial support from companies selling nutritional supplements and miracle cures — and that financial support is arguably a significant factor pushing the right to become more extreme. Indeed, right-wing extremism isn’t just an ideological movement that happens to get a lot of money from sellers of snake oil; some of its extremism can probably be seen not as a reflection of deep conviction, but as a way of promoting snake oil.",Web Resources,2021,"ideology, group",[]

Events since the election suggest no. I've already mentioned the Republican opposition lineup against Biden's assistance package. Rejection of economic populism is also seen at the state level. Think of Missouri. One of his senators, Josh Hawley, declared that Republicans should be ""a working-class party, not a Wall Street party."" However, Republicans in the state legislature have just blocked funding to expand Medicaid that would have a very low cost to the state and that had already been approved by most voters.What's going on?

It remains to be seen, of course, whether the eventual Democratic nominee will be in quite this place once the general election starts. * AND HAVE FIRES OF HATRED FOR OBAMACARE COOLED?The Washington Examiner's David Drucker offers some evidence for this theory.

If the organization's leader spends part of his time opposing the president's agenda in a land much like our own, there's nothing the members can do about it. The other disquieting aspect of Messina's misalliance is that it reflects an emerging set of political beliefs among some younger Democratic Party leaders who have grown close to Wall Street, Silicon Valley or both -- as Messina did while bringing both big money and technological wizardry to Obama's reelection campaign. This umpteenth iteration of the New Democrats believes in such socially liberal causes as gay marriage but is skeptical of unions and appalled at economic populism. At times, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel exemplifies this breed of Democrat, but the group's true poster child is Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who defended Wall Street during the 2012 controversy over Bain Capital's plant closings (""stop attacking private equity,"" he said on ""Meet The Press"") and who has actually had a high-tech start-up personally bestowed on him by his Silicon Valley fans. For Democrats such as these, Cameron's Tories, in their support for gay marriage, their opposition to labor (and Labor) and their defense of big banks against the European Union's efforts to regulate them, may look surprisingly simpatico.

Since many of the most active protesters today are students of color, there is greater potential for a coalition that includes inner-city taxpaying communities than there was when so many of the militants were from affluent suburbs.

The future of Trumpism

A loose collection of writers and thinkers has been working to develop an alternative interpretation of the 2020 election, to pave the way for constructive policy debates in coming years. In this interpretation, Trump's loss should point to a way that some of the good-but-unrealized impulses of his presidency — the economic populism he ran on in 2016, his willingness to break with conservative economic orthodoxy dating back decades on issues such as trade — can be salvaged and built upon. One such effort comes from American Compass, a think tank working to craft a pro-worker conservative populism, which just released a new package taking stock of the Trump years. In their telling, Trump's trade policies were compromised by his utter unwillingness to develop a comprehensive industrial policy (something that also exacerbated the coronavirus catastrophe and cleared space for Biden to stake out his own industrial policy agenda).

According to much newly minted conventional wisdom, Democrats can and should win back downscale whites by cranking up economic populism, without losing minorities, women and other key components of their coalition.

2023453250,Rebound for Trump possible if he learns,3/29/2017,SPH Media Limited,"The logic went something like this: Replacing the healthcare bill would bring about major reduction in government spending, which would then provide for new funds that would help finance the proposed tax cuts, and leave money for the US$1 trillion infrastructure project.  This may have made a lot of sense in theory, but in reality one problem was that during all the years they have been bashing Obamacare, the Republicans have not even tried to come up with a detailed plan of their own, which they had to do in a rush during the first 50 days of the Trump presidency.  The second problem was that congressional Republicans were divided, between members of the so-called Freedom Caucus who were elected under the banner of the Tea-Party movement and who wanted to get rid of the entire Obamacare and shift responsibility for healthcare to the states, and more moderate Republicans such as Mr Ryan who basically wanted to restructure the ACA so as to reduce government subsidies for the plan.  And then there were the tensions between the pro-business Mr Ryan and the rest of the GOP establishment, and between the proponents of Mr Trump's economic populist-nationalist agenda, led by White House strategist Stephen Bannon. The populists were worried that Mr Ryan's proposals would end up hurting the white blue-collar workers in rural areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, who had secured Mr Trump's electoral victory and who continued to be dependent on government assistance.  In fact, populists such as Mr Bannon were toying with the idea of a single-payer healthcare system in which the state, rather than private insurers, pays for healthcare costs, a view that was echoed by Mr Trump during the election campaign when he expressed interest in Canada's national healthcare system.  Bridging the differences among Republicans over healthcare would have been a difficult task under any condition, and became more like a mission impossible when Mr Ryan and his aides tried to author an Obamacare replacement while secluded for a few days in a hideout on Capitol Hill, taking little input from competing factions in the party.",Newspapers,2017,"person, policy, group, ideology",['white blue-collar workers']

At a party last month, a group in their 20s, many of them enrolled in the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas, unveiled a new state and federal PAC. Called Naturally Blue, its aim is to maintain the tenuous majority of Democrats in the Arkansas legislature to promote an agenda of economic populism and to take the fight to the rest of Dixie.

The Massachusetts senator insists she’s not running in 2016, but the conference made clear that progressives will hold midterm and presidential candidates to the populist standard she has set.

Activists here nearly all called Warren a “fighter” — a label she embraced in her speech Friday — and signaled they want other Democrats to get aggressive with banks, corporations and lobbyists to tackle income inequality.

A number of Republicans, who might have otherwise supported Trump’s action had they been involved in the process, sharply criticized the administration’s handling of the ordeal and called for swift changes.The botched rollout of the travel ban, according to a veteran of Capitol Hill and Republican campaigns, was emblematic of the challenges posed by the current power structure surrounding Trump.“There are not enough people of that ilk with the requisite experience to successfully operate the federal government,” said the strategist, who requested anonymity to speak more freely.“At the same time, the scope of the decisions that have to be made by the executive branch of the US government is so vast that you have to delegate power.”The tension surrounding the travel ban and its immediate aftermath also laid bare the fissures emerging between the various factions within the White House.As Bannon and Miller called the shots behind the scenes, crafting a policy that played directly to Trump’s base, Priebus and Spicer found themselves tasked with cleaning up the mess.Miller did, however, face the heat when MSNBC host Joe Scarborough launched into a stinging rebuke on his morning talkshow – regularly watched by Trump himself.“You’ve got a very young person in the White House on a power trip thinking that you can just write executive orders and tell all of your cabinet agencies to go to hell,” Scarborough said, before addressing Miller plainly.“By the time you’re 35, maybe you’ll know how Washington and the White House really works.“If you’re still around,” he added. “I hope you’re not.”Some close to Trump defended Miller, framing the outrage over the travel ban as driven by negative media coverage. Jason Miller, a former adviser to Trump, no relation to Stephen Miller, said the young aide had developed a unique understanding of Trump and his appeal on the campaign trail.“Steve really understands the economic populism movement both from his time working in conservative politics and being on the campaign trail,” Jason Miller told the Guardian.“He’s really clicked with the president and understands how the president wants to articulate and frame things.”Jason Miller also contested reports of dysfunction inside the West Wing, deeming many of the leaks from within the administration as the work of government officials who never wished for Trump to get elected.“Are some people getting their knickers in a twist because of the changes? Yeah,” he said. “But these are the things the president said he was going to fight for and advocate.”The core team at Trump’s side inside the Oval Office, Miller added, was unlikely to change.Trump’s campaign was nonetheless rocked by repeated shakeups. And the Trump White House is expected to be no different, where staffers of even the most even-keeled presidents are prone to burn out after only a few years.To some observers, those surrounding Trump are ultimately powerless in the face of a president who obsessively drives his own image.Referring to Trump’s contentious call with the Australian prime minister, Lindsey Graham said the incident was a precise example of where regardless of those standing at his shoulder, “the words of the president of the United States really matter”.“Eventually he’s the president.",Web Resources,2017,"person, policy, group",['economic populism movement']

By believing in an iron version of “demography is destiny” — something Teixeira and Judis never argued — the shadow party felt liberated from the necessities of conventional politics, opting to prioritize issues mainstream voters either don’t care very much about or disdain.It’s a very human response. If you think you’re going to win no matter what, why not indulge yourself?Teixera and Judis focus on four issues that tend to turn off more voters than they attract — at least in the way Democrats frame them: race, immigration, transgenderism and other forms of what they call “sexual creationism,” and climate change.None of this is to say Teixeira and Judis are conservatives on any of these issues. Their point is that by prioritizing extreme framing on these causes to the exclusion of the Democrats’ traditional economic populism led millions of white working-class voters to feel like the Democrats no longer cared about people like them. And now, there’s evidence that some of the non-white working class is going with them.For instance, “defund the police” was a compelling idea to the shadow party, but it has little appeal to mainstream voters of any race, who may have problems with police abuses, but have little tolerance for crime.

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

3126418768,Alaska Dispatch: Americans deliver message to Democratic Party: The economy isnt working,11/9/2024,Newstex,"Meanwhile, 8 in 10 said they hoped for “substantial change or complete and total upheaval” in how the country is run.That growing divide is prompting soul-searching among Democratic leaders, in the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election. Within days, factions of the Democratic Party have blamed their internal rivals for Tuesday's results, offering a range of conflicting explanations for the party's poor economic ratings among voters.Faced with the stark prospect of being shut out of the White House and both bodies of Congress, Democrats are pushing different - and incompatible - visions for reversing one of their worst electoral performances in years.“The insistence of a lot of Democratic economic spokesmen on inflation - ‘keep on walking, there's nothing to see here' - was not useful,” said Bill Galston, who served as a senior policy aide in the Clinton administration. “I always believed Biden would have been better served by an early and frank acknowledgment that they got it wrong.”More centrist voices in the party have since Tuesday revived their criticisms of President Joe Biden's 2021 stimulus plan, arguing it exacerbated inflation and hurt Vice President Kamala Harris even after Biden bowed out of the race. On the left, lawmakers and strategists faulted Biden for not more aggressively highlighting corporate price-gouging, and Harris for what they characterized as her move away from economic populism and embrace of billionaires such as Mark Cuban.ADVERTISEMENTSome progressive lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) argued that Democrats should have been more focused on economically populist messages, such as expanding Medicare benefits and raising the minimum wage, while publicly identifying the villains, such as Wall Street and the richest Americans. Harris's campaign did propose some aggressive policy plans, but liberal critics have said these policies were insufficient or diluted in her public communications.“We tried hard to do this - to have this campaign focus or emphasize an economic agenda that speaks to the need of the working class in this country,” said Sanders, who also extolled Harris's campaign and applauded her messages on abortion, democracy and Trump's unfitness for office. “The status quo is working very, very well for the people on top but it's not working well for working people, and the Democratic Party has become far too much a defender of the status quo.",Newspapers,2024,"person, policy, group, ideology",['progressives']

During his campaign, Trump prioritized a message of economic populism, including reopening coal mines and steel mills and advancing a major infrastructure spending bill. His first month in office has been dominated by divisive cultural issues -- such as a travel ban, expedited deportations and the repeal of a transgender bathroom executive order -- rather than the issues that matter most to the struggling working-class voters, a number of whom also supported former president Barack Obama.

Who makes up the various “camps” that Citizen Action hopes to draw into their lobbying efforts? There are three primary groups of voters who might be attracted to Citizen Action’s focus, according to Susan Kang, associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and member of the Democratic Socialists of America. She tells the Voice that she sees individuals who may have been attracted to former Ohio congressman and Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich’s progressive opposition to the Patriot Act and the Iraq War right through to followers of Senator Bernie Sanders’s populist presidential runs in 2016 and 2020 as one potential pool of progressive voters. Kang says, “These are voters we can describe as ‘economic Populists’ or similar to Democratic Socialists in Western Europe.” Historically, this group represents, Kang explains, “the limited wing of the Democratic party that wanted to keep the New Deal coalition alive even after it was out of vogue,” adding, “this group also includes the ‘anti-globalization’ crowd in the 1990s that challenged free-trade orthodoxy.”
A second pool of actual or potential supporters of progressive policies is what Kang calls “the diversity crowd.” She further clarifies, “These are people inspired by the politics of the social justice movements of the 1960s, like the Black civil rights movement, and more recently today’s BLM, LGBTQ rights, and Dreamers.” She says she would argue that folks who loved former president Barack Obama unconditionally because of his achievements as our first Black president fall into this camp as well. “BLM and Dreamers have economic justice agendas, but many identity-politics progressives focus on the diversity and non-discrimination part of the message, and the economic justice and redistributive message gets lost.” This camp, Kang says, “believes in the importance of meritocracy and that economic policies only need to ensure ‘equality of opportunity.’ For lack of a better term, this group includes what I call ‘woke’ sentiments. These are individuals who are mostly upwardly mobile, metro-region professionals.”
Kang also sees a third group, which she describes as the “newly emerging corps of volunteers—men, women, and youth not traditionally involved in local Democratic parties—who lump together as anti-Trump in their overall sentiments.” This group “is an amalgam of climate change activists, ‘Indivisible’ activists [a group dedicated to resisting Trump’s ongoing agenda], people who may have attended the first Women’s March upon Trump’s inauguration, and resistance groups who organize one-off and/or sustained activity.” This third camp, Kang says,” is not necessarily unified on its stance toward economic redistribution and universal social democratic policies.” Some members care about it more than others, and some tend to be agnostic about it. “But in general,” she explains, “most of the ‘anti-Trump’ crowd is more economically progressive than Democratic party leadership.",Web Resources,2022,"group, ideology","['Democratic Socialists', 'anti-globalization crowd', 'Democratic Socialists of America']"

Churchgoing Trump voters were still more culturally conservative than Hillary Clinton voters — more likely to support the death penalty, more skeptical of immigration — and their views of Muslims, interestingly, seemed to have been influenced by Trump’s own rhetoric, becoming more hostile between 2016 and 2017. But in general, churchgoing Republicans look more like the party many elite conservatives wanted to believe existed before Trump came along — more racially-tolerant, more accepting of multiculturalism and globalization, and also more consistently libertarian on economics. Secularized Trump voters look more like the party as Trump has tried to remake it, blending an inchoate economic populism with strong racial resentments. Interestingly in the survey the different groups make about the same amount of money, which cuts against strict economic-anxiety explanations for Trumpism. But the churchgoers and nonchurchgoers differ more in social capital: The irreligious are less likely to have college degrees, less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced; they’re also less civically engaged, less satisfied with their neighborhoods and communities, and less trusting and optimistic in general. This seems to support the argument, advanced by Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner among others, that support for populism correlates with a kind of communal breakdown, in which secularization is one variable among many leaving people feeling isolated and angry, and drawing them to the ersatz solidarity of white identity politics.",Web Resources,2018,"group, ideology",['non-churchgoing Trump voters']

Green continued:
The truth is: In swing seat after swing seat, Democrats won by running on economic populist positions that have long been supported by progressives and opposed by corporate Democrats — such as protecting and expanding Social Security benefits and fighting the pharmaceutical companies and Wall Street banks that fund Third Way.

His efforts to cancel some student loan debt have also won praise from progressives, although that executive order has faced legal challenges.Adam Green, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he still considers Biden’s most recent policy decisions to be “exceptions” rather than the rule of his governing philosophy.

What’s more, not all swing voters have the same interests and priorities, and the Catholic swing voter has a fairly distinctive profile. As Mark Stricherz of (appropriately enough) CatholicVote.Org has argued, such voters are more likely to be “culturally conservative, economically populist or liberal, and moderate to liberal on foreign policy.” (They’re also more likely to abound in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.) Hence the advice that the Catholic Democrat Jim Arkedis offered to the Obama campaign in this space last week: To win Catholic swing voters, emphasize social justice and economic solidarity, but don’t try “to drive a wedge between the faithful and official church positions” on culture-war issues. This is sound advice for Democratic politicians, but it’s also advice that this particular Democratic White House has conspicuously failed to take. Instead, the Department of Health and Human Services’ mandate requiring religious institutions to purchase health care plans that cover sterilization, contraception and the morning-after pill has made the institutional Church itself – its universities, its schools, its hospitals, its charitable organizations – an issue in this election.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

The White House called the spending bill the best the administration could hope for -- and a better deal than it was likely to get when Republicans take control. 

Sen. Elizabeth Warren : The Massachusetts senator's opposition to the spending bill gave cover for House Democrats to vote no and firmed up her position as the voice of economic populism heading into 2015. 

The big question is whether she uses that role to press the White House from the left, to build a base for the 2016 presidential sweepstakes. The Ready for Warren group aiming to draft her into a national race made two big splashes this week, though Ms. Warren maintains that she is not seeking the presidency.

Some activists go further and call on Democrats to stop talking about social issues other than income inequality, although Mr. Sanders hasn't gone there.

Harris also ran detectably to Biden's right when it came to labor, antitrust, and the economy. Winning on that message could convince Democrats that their dalliance with economic populism was unnecessary, which would speed up the class realignment already underway, with more working class voters of all races and genders feeling unrepresented by Democrats, who come to fully stand in for coastal elites. With Democrats representing an upper-middle-class center, that leaves a coalition of the working class and the super rich in the Republican party. That's an extremely dangerous coalition, and while it will be hampered by Trump's defeat, it would be structurally strengthened longterm by a Harris victory—unless Harris somehow finds populist Jesus like Biden did.

(Their headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, in an Art Deco tower in the shadow of the Citigroup Center.)
Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for “revolution,” finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that “Rewriting the Rules” might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party’s near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment.

In a survey released this September by the Washington-based non-profit Public Religion Research Institute, white workingclass Americans - i.e., wage-earning workers without a four-year college diploma, who are the traditional recruiting corps for evangelical political leaders - voiced a striking disinterest in the culture wars. Just one in 20 of the respondents to the Institute's national phone survey reported that ""either abortion (3 percent) or same-sex marriage (2 percent) is the most important issue to their vote,"" while 53 percent cited the economy. And drilling down on matters of economic policy, the poll found that ""white working-class Americans display a strong strain of economic populism."" Among these findings:


* 46 percent of white working-class Americans believe that capitalism is ""at odds with Christian values.""


* 78 percent say that corporations that move jobs overseas are responsible for America's economic distress. 

* 62 percent favor raising taxes on households with incomes of more than $1 million a year.

The sociological transformation of the Republican Party into a working-class party means that its base has more in common economically with the average black American than the country-club GOP of yore.

And the economic populism and foreign-policy anti-interventionism of Trumpism - well, at least campaign-season Trumpism - were closer to common African-American views than the typical Republican agenda. So black America and conservatism have converged in interesting ways - but in the most important way they are inevitably divided, for the obvious reason that Donald Trump's ascent began with a racist conspiracy theory and then added other white-identitarian appeals.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

In reality, he suggested that a Republican Party with a more populist economic message might win the missing whites and more minority votes as well. But an explicit ""double down on white voters"" argument has circulated for years on the margins of conservatism, and it had obvious influence over Donald Trump's campaign strategy in 2016. His mix of economic populism and deliberate racial polarization was supposed to be demographically foredoomed - but instead it won him precisely those regions Trende's analysis had highlighted, and the presidency as well. For a sense of why this happened, in defiance of so much prognostication, look at the new Pew analysis of the 2016 election, which relies on voter files to create a more accurate assessment of who actually voted. Compared to exit polls, a couple of things stand out: First, Pew has whites at 74 percent of all voters (CNN's exit poll had them at 71 percent), and second, it has whites without a college degree, Trump's key constituency, at 44 percent of all voters (compared to just 34 percent for CNN).

More than 100 such groups were identified in the early 1930s by the American Civil Liberties Union, most of which either imitated the European coloured shirt movements (so that by 1934 the US had the Silver Shirts, the White Shirts and Gentile League, the Khaki Shirts, the Gray Shirts, and many others) or formed militant Christian groups, such as ""Defenders of the Christian Faith"" or the ""Christian Front"". Together they declared their hatred of ""alien"" elements and ideas, including not only other religions (primarily Judaism) and races, but also liberalism, socialism and communism, all of which they lumped together in the name of jingoist nationalism: such groups always declared themselves ""pro-American"". As such groups could originate in economic populism, evangelical Christian nationalism (which could be anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, or both), or in historical white supremacy, some historians have concluded that they represent uniquely American disorders: aberrations created by the nation's fraught history of the tension between its ideals of liberal democracy for (white male) citizens and the authoritarian systems under which it subjugated everyone else. The argument that American nativist, xenophobic, conspiratorially anti-Semitic and white supremacist paramilitary groups were categorically different from their counterparts in Europe was much less likely to be made during the interwar years, however - not least because almost everyone could see the way they both leveraged existing bigotries on behalf of reactionary populism. Historians of fascism have also demonstrated that all fascism is indigenous by definition. As Robert O Paxton explained in his seminal 1998 essay ""The Five Stages of Fascism"", ""authentic fascism is not for export"" because all fascisms draw ""their slogans and their symbols from the patriotic repertory of one particular community"".",Magazines,2020,"group, ideology","['Silver Shirts', 'White Shirts and Gentile League']"

The Democrats do not have an overwhelming electoral majority — and certainly not a majority that can count on overcoming congressional gerrymandering, the red-state bias of the Senate and the traditional advantage for the opposition party in midterm elections — but they have a majority all the same. And if Mr. Biden’s approach up to this point has been good enough to keep roughly 53 percent of the country solidly with him, it might not take a major political breakthrough — let alone a season of them — to reinforce that coalition by winning over just a small slice of doubters or critics. There are strategists in Mr. Biden’s coalition who hope to do considerably more than that, either by maneuvering the Democratic Party more decisively toward the political center or by competing more assertively with Republicans on themes of economic populism (or perhaps through some combination of the two). Mr. Biden’s aides have already briefed congressional Democrats several times on their plans to lean hard into promoting the economic recovery as the governing party’s signature achievement — one they hope to reinforce further with a victory on infrastructure.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, has campaigned on sharp criticism of trade agreements and suggested his message may appeal to disaffected Democrats. Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Friday that Kaine’s support of fast track for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has given Republicans “a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.”
“It’s now more important than ever that Hillary Clinton run an aggressive campaign on core economic ideas like expanding Social Security, debt-free college, Wall Street reform, and yes, stopping the TPP,” Taylor said. “It’s the best way to unite the Democratic Party, and stop Republicans from winning over swing voters on bread-and-butter issues.”
Paul Brace, a political scientist at Rice University in Houston, said Clinton’s choice of Kaine, in the short run, “may disappoint the Bernie supporters who want a more progressive VP.”
Even so, Brace said, “Bernie supporters will have a choice, while not their optimal choice, as Clinton seems to be tacking to the center on the premise that the left won’t possibly jump to Trump on trade.”

Some states remained excruciatingly close, but the president was convinced of the outcome and did not want to question the legitimacy of the election as Trump had done just weeks earlier while facing off against Clinton in the debates.“You need to concede,” Obama told Clinton after his political director had failed to persuade Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, on the point.It took one more phone call from the president – to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta – before she asked her close aide Huma Abedin for the phone and uttered the words she never thought she would say: “Congratulations, Donald.“I’ll be supportive of the country’s success, and that means your success as president,” Clinton said.It was after her brief conversation with Trump that Clinton apologized to Obama.The book is the second collaboration for Allen and Parnes, who in 2014 authored HRC, a detailed account of Clinton’s tenure at the helm of the state department, in anticipation of her second presidential run.As the first take on Clinton’s doomed campaign, they offer a behind-the-scenes view of the obstacles in her way – some familiar and others a consequence of the shifting American electorate.There is the familiar tension between the old guard that has for decades operated “Clintonworld” and the new blood that labored in Brooklyn to reinvent the campaign of one of the most well-known public figures in the world.The authors revisit the unexpected challenge from Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent campaign captured the wave of economic populism sweeping the country. The infighting amid the Democratic primaries, as Team Clinton struggled to decisively put away the senator, is a dominant theme of the book’s first half.And then there are the emails.The aftermath of Clinton’s decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, and subsequent discord among her inner circle over how to respond, is retold with the benefit of hindsight. We learn that Bill Clinton did not believe she should apologize, as neither he nor she felt there had been any wrongdoing.Clinton eventually did apologize to the public in August 2015, six months after the server issue was first brought to light.The role of Russian interference in the US election, now the subject of three investigations in Washington, is barely explored in the book, although the authors do say that Clinton’s former aides see it as one of the main reasons for her loss.The effects of Trump’s nationalist campaign are also relegated to the backseat, as this is a story primarily told through how Clinton’s campaign adapted (or sometimes crucially didn’t) to the evolving political climate. Staffers were confident in their sophisticated voter modeling and analytics, and fatally failed to spot when they veered off target.Clinton, for her part, carried a lingering doubt throughout the campaign.“Why aren’t they with me?” she asked of working class white people during the Democratic primaries.",Web Resources,2017,"person, group, ideology",['Bernie Sanders campaign']

One of the clearest takeaways from the midterms is that if Joe Biden wants to defang criticism of how he’s handled inflation—which does appear to finally be dropping, but still bothers voters—he should target big business and Wall Street.Instead, the Biden White House is apparently desperate to bring a Wall Street businessman into a senior administration job.

The latter would mean finding a way to make the Republican Party more appealing – via, yes, some kind of economic populism — to the middle class and working class voters whose parents and grandparents would have been New Deal/Great Society Democrats, but who have shifted back and forth between the two coalitions since the 1970s.

Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

""I don't see any evidence, at least at the grass-roots level, that the Republican Party is morphing into a vehicle for authoritarian rule,"" said political scientist Matthew Dickinson, an expert on the presidency, in an e-mail interview. ""Trump did highlight a deep strain of political and economic populism within the Republican electorate, but I didn't see evidence that people were willing to cede authority to a strongman and his ruling clique."" Of course, the GOP's grass-roots, which account for much of the demand side of the political propaganda market, may not be all that reliable a bulwark.

Frustrated progressives do not discount the need to warn voters of Trump's authoritarian leanings, but some wish her closing message was more focused on addressing voters' overwhelming pessimism about the state of the economy and the direction of the country. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, praised Harris' advertising team for “smartly” investing hundreds of millions of dollars behind ads focusing on grocery prices, taxing billionaires and Social Security — “things that both win swing voters and pump up the base.”
But, Green said, “there’s been an odd disconnect between the campaign’s economic populist ad strategy and the event strategy that focuses almost exclusively on Liz Cheney kumbaya optics that depress the base right as voting begins and don’t provably win more swing voters than bread-and-butter issues.”
Other are frustrated that the Harris campaign hasn't featured progressive leaders like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez in higher-profile spots. Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, suggested that as many as 10% of progressives may not vote for Harris because of their frustrations.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

2023453250,Rebound for Trump possible if he learns,3/29/2017,SPH Media Limited,"The logic went something like this: Replacing the healthcare bill would bring about major reduction in government spending, which would then provide for new funds that would help finance the proposed tax cuts, and leave money for the US$1 trillion infrastructure project. This may have made a lot of sense in theory, but in reality one problem was that during all the years they have been bashing Obamacare, the Republicans have not even tried to come up with a detailed plan of their own, which they had to do in a rush during the first 50 days of the Trump presidency. The second problem was that congressional Republicans were divided, between members of the so-called Freedom Caucus who were elected under the banner of the Tea-Party movement and who wanted to get rid of the entire Obamacare and shift responsibility for healthcare to the states, and more moderate Republicans such as Mr Ryan who basically wanted to restructure the ACA so as to reduce government subsidies for the plan. And then there were the tensions between the pro-business Mr Ryan and the rest of the GOP establishment, and between the proponents of Mr Trump's economic populist-nationalist agenda, led by White House strategist Stephen Bannon. The populists were worried that Mr Ryan's proposals would end up hurting the white blue-collar workers in rural areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, who had secured Mr Trump's electoral victory and who continued to be dependent on government assistance. In fact, populists such as Mr Bannon were toying with the idea of a single-payer healthcare system in which the state, rather than private insurers, pays for healthcare costs, a view that was echoed by Mr Trump during the election campaign when he expressed interest in Canada's national healthcare system. Bridging the differences among Republicans over healthcare would have been a difficult task under any condition, and became more like a mission impossible when Mr Ryan and his aides tried to author an Obamacare replacement while secluded for a few days in a hideout on Capitol Hill, taking little input from competing factions in the party.",Newspapers,2017,"person, policy, group, ideology",['white blue-collar workers']

California Democrats have a unique opportunity to lead the nation in building a strong working-class agenda beyond government programs to win back blue-collar workers, especially Latino voters.

California’s income inequality divide is the largest it’s been since the Great Recession. Pressures on the disappearing middle class are getting worse, not better.Running against Republicans has been a successful tactic for a generation of California Democrats seeking Latino support, but it’s not going to be sufficient.

Reagan got the big issues of the future wrong — foreign policy, trade and immigration.”
The ascendancy of Donald Trump, whose economic populism and nationalist instincts are at odds with the free-enterprise principles and foreign-policy idealism of Reaganism, has been the main driver of Mr. Reagan’s reassessment. A Pew poll last year found that 41 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Mr. Reagan as the best president of the past 40 years, while 37 percent awarded that laurel to Mr. Trump. The result is a veritable schism on the right over Mr. Reagan’s legacy, and more broadly, over whether the conservative past should shape its future. What’s perhaps most telling about this internal battle, however, is that the various factions — those who reject Reaganism, those who defend it and those who stress the commonalities between Reaganism and Trumpism — all tend to paint portraits of Mr. Reagan that omit the very attributes that made him such a broadly popular political figure: his pragmatism and nose for compromise.",Web Resources,2024,"person, group, ideology",['Trump supporters']

For one thing, peoples’ motivations to join the anti-Obama backlash are a bit mysterious in Pity the Billionaire, and so while the voices of the manipulators on Wall Street and Capitol Hill are amplified, the skillfully manipulated populace is nearly silent. This hints at the book’s larger problem: Frank is both a student and a proponent of old-school, labor-centered economic populism, and like the hammer-wielding carpenter who thinks every problem looks like a nail, his insistence on explaining the Tea Party surge strictly through high-level business babble is doomed to fail. Frank writes that “the paranoid/racist moments in Tea Party history are singled out and obsessively commented upon, while its vastly more significant free-market streak is either regarded as camouflage for what the libs know to be its real payload—some kind of theocratic white supremacy.” But when I traveled cross-country in 2009 and 2010 reporting on what the foot soldiers of the new right wing actually had to say, I found that nothing animated them more than fears of a rapidly changing nation where nonwhites will soon be the majority, as well as a deeply held conviction that the first black president is fundamentally not American, a factor given short shrift by Frank. While the noise about unfettered free markets from the top of the GOP message machine grew louder in 2009–10, at the bottom of the pyramid were the same cultural resentments laid bare in What’s the Matter with Kansas?, amplified by anxieties about Obama. Meanwhile, the comparative silence of the modern-day Left in Pity the Billionaire is not really Frank’s fault as it is the failing of liberalism itself.",Magazines,2012,"group, ideology",['Occupy Wall Street']

Yet the social fissures that have made Trump such a durable figure have also cemented Biden as the head of a majority coalition with broad dominance of the country’s most populous areas. The Democrats do not have an overwhelming electoral majority — and certainly not a majority that can count on overcoming congressional gerrymandering, the red-state bias of the Senate and the traditional advantage for the opposition party in midterm elections — but they have a majority all the same. And if Biden’s approach up to this point has been good enough to keep roughly 53% of the country solidly with him, it might not take a major political breakthrough — let alone a season of them — to reinforce that coalition by winning over just a small slice of doubters or critics.

There are strategists in Biden’s coalition who hope to do considerably more than that, either by maneuvering the Democratic Party more decisively toward the political center or by competing more assertively with Republicans on themes of economic populism (or perhaps through some combination of the two).

2235464378,"Tech Titans Build Lobbyist Army, Trying to Repel Threats to Power",6/6/2019,New York Times Company,"WASHINGTON -- Faced with the growing possibility of antitrust actions and legislation to curb their power, four of the biggest technology companies are amassing an army of lobbyists as they prepare for what could be an epic fight over their futures.Initially slow to develop a presence in Washington, the tech giants -- Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google -- have rapidly built themselves into some of the largest players in the influence and access industry as they confront threats from the Trump administration and both parties on Capitol Hill.The four companies spent a combined $55 million on lobbying last year, doubling their combined spending of $27.4 million in 2016, and some are spending at a higher rate so far this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying and political contributions. That puts them on a par with long-established lobbying powerhouses like the defense, automobile and banking industries.As they have tracked increasing public and political discontent with their size, power, handling of user data and role in elections, the four companies have intensified their efforts to lure lobbyists with strong connections to the White House, the regulatory agencies, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress.Of the 238 people registered to lobby for the four companies in the first three months of this year -- both in-house employees and those on contract from lobbying and law firms -- about 75 percent formerly served in the government or on political campaigns, according to an analysis of lobbying and employment records. Many worked in offices or for officials who could have a hand in deciding the course of the new governmental scrutiny.The influence campaigns encompass a broad range of activities, including calls on members of Congress, advertising, funding of think-tank research and efforts to get the attention of President Trump, whose on-again, off-again streak of economic populism is of particular concern to the big companies.Last month, the industry lobbying group, the Internet Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, awarded its Internet Freedom Award to Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and White House senior adviser.""They are no longer upstarts dipping a toe in lobbying,"" said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. ""They have both feet in.""Facebook and Google are dogged by concerns over their handling of consumer data, harmful content and misinformation. Amazon's rapid expansion has been met with unease over labor conditions and the company's effect on small businesses.

Reagan also pushed trickle-down economics, a Republican idea that contributed mightily to the opening of the greatest gap in income in the nation's history and a grotesque concentration of wealth at the top of society. So now we've entered an era where any remnant of economic populism, once proudly proclaimed by Democrats, has been smothered by the influence of moneyed elites and corporations on the political process. We have a political class -- Democrats and Republicans both -- that caters to the corporate class, and the rest of us are mere bystanders. Historians always caution against generalities and premature assessments. But we are in a different place now, with super-partisanship based more on obstructionism than on any convincing ideology, with a Republican Party pushed even further to the right by anti-government libertarians and gun fanatics, and with a Democratic Party afraid to stand up for its ideals, including its only important accomplishment of the Obama era, the passage of the Affordable Care Act.",Newspapers,2014,"ideology, group",['Democrats']

His elevation to the presidency was deemed a laughable impossibility: the Clinton camp reacted with “ giddy disbelief ” when he became the Republican frontrunner in early 2016. Yes, Clinton suffered misogyny, and Russia undoubtedly preferred Trump and acted on it: yet the latter factor has become a Clintonian comfort blanket, a means to avoid a post mortem on the politics of the Democratic failure. As veteran Democratic Representative Barbara Lee told me just after Donald Trump’s “American carnage” inauguration speech, there was no shortage of political mobilisation against Trump in the US election: “What I didn’t see in there was the clarity of what our platform was.” Indeed, as a prominent US progressive campaigner, Ben Wikler, put it: “If you ask people what Hillary Clinton’s platform was, they couldn’t tell you … If you asked people what Donald Trump’s platform was, everyone could tell you.”

Since his election, many analyses of his political program have focussed on his ties to the alt-right, a nebulous and evolving constellation of dissidents who sharply disagree with many of the conservative movement's widely accepted tenets--including, often, its avowed commitment to racial equality. This connection runs through Stephen Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, an ""economic nationalist"" who was previously the executive chairman of Breitbart, a news site that aimed to be, Bannon once said, ""the platform for the alt-right.""

The Democrats were supposed to be competitive in the Senate and the House.In that scenario, Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, might have been in effect sidelined as Democrats hunkered down for four years of a steady, if unspectacular, continuation of Barack Obama’s centrist agenda.But instead, Donald Trump won the election – with an anti-establishment message that bore some similarities to Sanders’ own government-outsider election bid – and Sanders has found himself promoted from anti-establishment outsider to the Democrats’ leadership bench.Indeed, some Sanders progressives now see Trump’s victory as a validation of the populist agenda Sanders championed during his campaign.“Progressives are used to punching up, but here we find ourselves in a real position of credibility and power,” said Raul Grijalva of Arizona, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive caucus.As the party seeks to rebuild in 2017, caucus members believe the election of the DNC chair is an early test of whether Democrats will embrace economic populism.Sanders’ first priority is to elect Keith Ellison, the progressive congressman from Minnesota, as DNC chair. Ellison, who is seen as the frontrunner, is being challenged by the labor secretary, Tom Perez, who enters with support from allies of Clinton and the Obama administration.“Right now we are fighting for the chair of the DNC and it is truly emblematic of the division within the Democrats,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of the National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders during the primary. “If the Democratic party rejects the Sanders base, it will be at their extreme peril.”On a tactical level, all eyes are on 2018 and how to elect progressives to seats at the local, state and national level.“We have to do in 2018 what the Tea Party did in 2010,” said Dan Cantor, the founder and executive director of the Working Families party.Though Sanders has become synonymous with the progressive movement, activists say 2017 won’t hinge on voters feeling the Bern.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

2319788907,The Case for Bernie,12/1/2019,New York Times Company,"But it's still reasonable for Democratic voters to look for someone who can do a version of what Harris was supposed to do, and build a coalition across the party's many axes of division.And there's an interesting case that the candidate best positioned to do this -- the one whose support is most diverse right now -- is the candidate whom Obama allegedly promised to intervene against if his nomination seemed likely: the resilient Socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.Like other candidates, Sanders's support has a demographic core: Just as Elizabeth Warren depends on very liberal professionals and Joe Biden on older minorities and moderates, Bernie depends intensely on the young. But his polling also shows an interesting better-than-you-expect pattern, given stereotypes about his support. He does better-than-you-expect with minorities despite having struggled with them in 2016, with moderate voters and $100K-plus earners despite being famously left-wing, and with young women despite all the BernieBro business.This pattern explains why, in early-state polling, Sanders shows the most strength in very different environments -- leading Warren everywhere in the latest FiveThirtyEight average, beating Biden in Iowa and challenging him in more-diverse Nevada, matching Pete Buttigieg in New Hampshire and leading him easily in South Carolina and California.Now, I have stacked the argument slightly, and left out a crucial axis of division where Sanders does worse than you expect: He struggles badly with his fellow Social Security recipients, the over-65. This weakness and Biden's strength with these same voters are obvious reasons to doubt the case for Bernie as the unifier, Bernie as the eventual nominee.Especially since Sanders has thus far ignored my advice (I know, the nerve) that he reassure skeptics by telling them that he has a record as a dealmaker, that he can moderate on certain issues, so they can feel safe supporting him even if they aren't ready for the revolution.But still: If you are a wavering Democrat concerned about both party unity and ultimate electability, about exciting all the diverse factions of your base while also competing for the disaffected, both the relative breadth of Bernie's primary coalition and his decent polling among non-voters and Obama-Trump voters are reasons to give him another look.That decent polling, I suspect, reflects a sense among voters drawn to populism that Bernie is different from not only the more centrist candidates -- latecomers Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick especially, but Buttigieg as well -- but also from his fellow left-winger, Warren, who has fully embraced the culture-war breadth of the new progressivism while Sanders remains, fundamentally, an economic-policy monomaniac.He's still a social liberal, of course, and he isn't in the culturally conservative/economic populist quadrant where so many unrepresented voters reside. But for the kind of American who is mostly with the Democrats on economics but wary of progressivism's zest for culture war, Sanders's socialism might be strangely reassuring -- as a signal of what he actually cares about, and what battles he might eschew for the sake of his anti-plutocratic goals. (At the very least he's no more radical on an issue like abortion than a studied moderate like Mayor Pete.)This is why, despite technically preferring a moderate like Biden or Amy Klobuchar, I keep coming back to the conservative's case for Bernie -- which rests on the perhaps-wrong but still attractive supposition that he's the liberal most likely to spend all his time trying to tax the rich and leave cultural conservatives alone.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

But the antiabortion McKinney lost a tight party contest to the pro-abortion rights, economically populist Thompson.

In Washington, the state hit hardest by the coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreak's effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the polls. UNION SUPPORT
Biden was powered to victory on Tuesday by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, union members and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls. In Michigan, he performed well with union members and working-class white voters, two groups that helped Sanders to an upset victory of Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016 but did not turn out as strongly for him this time despite Sanders' economic populism and his call for universal healthcare. Sanders won large majorities of voters under 30 years old in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, yet that group had a smaller impact on the results this year. Voters between 18 and 29 made up 12% of the Democratic primary electorate in Missouri, 10% in Mississippi and 15% in Michigan, down at least 4 percentage points in each state from 2016.

ANALYSIS: President Barack Obama announced his new financial sector regulatory initiative alongside former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker -- an advocate of re-regulation who had largely been sidelined until the Democratic party last week suffered a major defeat in a by-election for an open Senate seat (see UNITED STATES: Obama attempts major tone, agenda shift - January  22, 2010).  Thus, the move is in part intended to counter the perception that the administration has been 'soft' on the banking sector  (see UNITED STATES: Despite FCIC, financial reform stalls - January  14, 2010).  The White House sees moving out in front of the building wave of economic populism as crucial to Democratic party prospects in November's mid-term congressional elections.   Policy pivot  Before last week's about-face, administration policymakers, led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers, generally favoured a cautious, technocratic approach to financial sector reform.  The administration's tepid legislative proposals failed to attract much public enthusiasm, and prospects for significant legislation appeared poor. Two-part proposal The administration's latest proposal contains two parts, each subject to congressional approval: The 'Volcker rule'  Obama would limit the scope of activities in which financial firms can engage, so as ""to ensure that no bank or financial institution that contains a bank will own, invest in or sponsor a hedge fund or a private equity fund, or proprietary trading operations unrelated to serving customers for its own profit"".",Newspapers,2010,"person, policy, group",['Democrats']

And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action.

Years in the wilderness.If Donald Trump is defeated in next month's election, the Republican Party will face a reckoning unprecedented in modern political history.Why it matters: Never before has a party's identity been so deeply entwined with the fate, fortunes and flaws of one man. Four consecutive poor election cycles would unleash a wave of sustained scrutiny that the GOP — as it currently exists — may not survive.The big picture: Right now, it's difficult to see through the November fog.As Axios reported last week, Trump is laying the groundwork to deny the results of the election, again spreading a litany of baseless fraud claims in anticipation of his potential defeat.Election challenges are inevitable — Republicans already have filed over 100 lawsuits — and voting results may not be finalized for weeks, if not months.Now put that to one side.If Vice President Kamala Harris ultimately is inaugurated in January, a rudderless Republican Party will be forced — for the first time — to move on from Trump, who has said he will not seek the 2028 nomination.At last week's VP debate, Sen. JD Vance gave us a window of what MAGA sans Trump could look like — presenting a polished case for economic populism without the cult of personality.But any ideological successor would face challenges: Even the Trumpiest candidates have historically underperformed the former president, whose unique appeal to disaffected voters has proven hard to replicate.What to watch: Anti-Trump Republicans — a cohort that swelled in the aftermath of Jan. 6 — are salivating at the prospect of reclaiming their party.Former Rep. Liz Cheney, who campaigned for Harris last week, would be among the conservative leaders seeking to restore democracy as a core Republican value.So would Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador and presidential candidate who has been a harsh critic of Trump's isolationist foreign policy (though she says she intends to vote for him).But given the years of hostility toward establishment Republicans — and the probable entrenchment of pro-MAGA forces, even if Trump fades away — the most likely outcome is a deeply fractured party.Flashback: We saw glimpses of that after the 2022 midterms, when Republicans' underwhelming performance led to recriminations and a fleeting push to abandon Trump.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a conservative culture warrior who had won re-election in a landslide, appeared set to inherit the MAGA throne, backed by the Murdoch media empire.Then it all came crashing down: Republicans rallied around Trump after his indictments, and DeSantis' presidential campaign imploded under a vengeful onslaught from the former president and his allies.Reality check: Trump could still win.",Web Resources,2024,"person, group, ideology",['MAGA']

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, declined to describe her positions on a variety of current regulatory and Wall Street issues but said in an email: “Reducing inequality and increasing upward mobility has been an uninterrupted pursuit of hers through every job she’s held, and it continues to this day in her work at the Clinton Foundation.”

Cruz delivered ""sermons from the stump,"" hoping for a huge evangelical vote. But that did not materialize, because ""evangelicals differ not only in their politics but in their religiosity.""

The action would additionally reflect a tension within the White House between the economic populists, who have argued for more aggressive and adversarial moves against foreign countries, and the growing influence of pragmatists, who have called for a more measured approach. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked other countries over their trade practices. French tourist dies, 7 others hurt in Turkey balloon crash

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

And it was a reminder of a different political dynamic in 2016: Eight years ago, her policy disagreements with Obama — regarded as a more serious challenger than Sanders — were rarely as clear-cut. The shift to the left has some middle-of-the-road Democrats nervous about their general election prospects once the primary season is finished. If the likely nominee tacks left, they worry, Republicans could claw back the White House despite their demographic disadvantages.“The party as a whole has drifted in a leftward direction since the 2008 election,” warned Jonathan Cowan, president of the centrist Third Way think tank, specifically referring to its positions on trade and economic populism. “[And Clinton] has made an unmistakable shift to the left. It’s not about any one particular policy announcement, it’s about the totality of it.""Yet that’s not remotely a concern to Team Clinton, said a number of Democrats aligned with her campaign, particularly since national polling demonstrates that the country at large sides with Clinton on background checks, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and marriage equality.To Democrats like Cowan, though, Clinton’s willingness to play on Sanders’ terms spells trouble, particularly with independent voters.“Every successful national Democrat since the party fell apart and Mondale lost 49 states has their Sister Souljah moment,” he said, referring to Bill Clinton’s 1992 distancing himself from an activist who spoke about racial violence. “We don’t know what [Hillary Clinton’s] is, and she is not going to become president unless she has one and shows she’s not a doctrinaire Democrat.""For Clinton, who is widely considered to be more moderate than Sanders, dealing with the party’s ideological evolution has constituted a balancing act.",Web Resources,2015,"person, ideology, group","['progressives', 'not Third Way']"

That high figure helps explain why efforts to preserve abortion rights in Kansas, Ohio and other places have been so successful.But it's not just abortion. The survey found overwhelming support for leaders who fight to raise the minimum wage, to protect the right to form a union and to make quality child care more affordable -- policy descriptions that seem ripped from President Biden's campaign speeches.The trouble is that a significant number of the respondents didn't associate these policies with Democrats.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

3099367388,‘Let Reagan Be Reagan’,9/2/2024,New York Times Company,"(A judicious biography, “Reagan,” by Max Boot, is scheduled for publication on Sept. 10.)But all this fanfare can’t obscure the fact that Mr. Reagan’s reputation has come under fire in recent years from an unlikely quarter: conservatives.“Boomer porn,” Curt Mills, the executive director of The American Conservative, scoffed when I told him about the event in Dixon. “Reagan may have been a conservative, but he wasn’t a nationalist. Reagan got the big issues of the future wrong — foreign policy, trade and immigration.”The ascendancy of Donald Trump, whose economic populism and nationalist instincts are at odds with the free-enterprise principles and foreign-policy idealism of Reaganism, has been the main driver of Mr. Reagan’s reassessment. A Pew poll last year found that 41 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Mr. Reagan as the best president of the past 40 years, while 37 percent awarded that laurel to Mr. Trump.The result is a veritable schism on the right over Mr. Reagan’s legacy, and more broadly, over whether the conservative past should shape its future. What’s perhaps most telling about this internal battle, however, is that the various factions — those who reject Reaganism, those who defend it and those who stress the commonalities between Reaganism and Trumpism — all tend to paint portraits of Mr. Reagan that omit the very attributes that made him such a broadly popular political figure: his pragmatism and nose for compromise.That oversight, unless and until it is corrected, bodes poorly for the future of the conservative movement and the Republican Party.The group driving the debate over Mr. Reagan’s legacy — call them the dissenters — seeks to bury his influence.

When the pro-Trump group America First Policies first jumped into the race with advertising, it was viewed as a turning point by DCCC operatives, who saw the move as evidence that an entirely new piece of the GOP infrastructure was swooping in to save the seat for Handel. The DCCC then injected more money into the race than initially planned and intensified its direct mail get-out-the-vote program.With the race turning away from its early framing as a referendum on Trump, Democratic operatives have instead looked closely at Ossoff’s campaign for clues about messaging that other Democrats might emulate next year. That’s been a sensitive exercise: Democratic establishment strategists fret that the party’s liberal insurgent wing will take an Ossoff loss as evidence that candidates need a clearer, Bernie Sanders-like message of economic populism, while progressive leaders worry an Ossoff win could encourage the party to recruit more moderates.The race’s potential to exacerbate internal divisions is one reason the DCCC has sought to remind its allies over and over about the district's conservative leanings.

Democratic leaders were determined to boost the party with people who didn't vote for Joe Biden in 2020, particularly the White voters without college degrees who have shifted to the GOP over the past several decades.So Democrats focused largely on economic policy, such as the American Rescue Plan, the infrastructure bill and a law making it easier to manufacture microchips in the United States. They intentionally highlighted how these provisions would help people without college degrees and people in rural areas.They at times sidelined other issues, such as voting rights, that might not be the priorities of White voters without college degrees. It's great that the Democrats are finally moving on from the overly business-friendly, neoliberal economic policies they embraced from the early 1980s through the 2010s and helped lead to massive inequality and decimation of small towns across the Midwest.The party's new economic populism will help all Americans, not just White voters without degrees. And in the long term, I think this agenda will help the party electorally, by making clear to voters that Democrats are the party that most represents the interests of average Americans.It's morally good and potentially politically useful for Democrats to try to reach Trump voters.But this strategy wasn't working — and party leaders stuck to it for far too long. In the short term, the United States needs Democrats to win elections to prevent an increasingly extreme, antidemocratic Republican Party from gaining more power.And at least right now, the vast majority of White Protestants and White voters without degrees are embracing and in some ways driving the Republican Party's drift to radicalism.

During his campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked others countries over their trade practices, arguing other countries were contributing to the US trade deficit - the gap between the cost of a country's imports and its exports - by using subsidies and other practices to undercut US firms and lure away jobs. 
Through export subsidies, foreign government provide funds to help their manufacturers lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive to international buyers - a practice is often viewed as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

2610780935,Conservatism After Christianity,9/16/2018,New York Times Company,"The trend was consistent: The more often a Trump voter attended church, the less white-identitarian they appeared, the more they expressed favorable views of racial minorities, and the less they agreed with populist arguments on trade and immigration.The differences were particularly striking on race. For instance, a quarter of Trump voters who never attend church describe being white as ""very important"" to their identity; for the most frequent churchgoers voters, it was 9 percent. Among non-churchgoing Trump voters, only 48 percent had warm feelings toward black people, compared to 71 percent of weekly churchgoers; the same sort of pattern held for views of Hispanics, Asians and Jews.Churchgoing Trump voters were still more culturally conservative than Hillary Clinton voters -- more likely to support the death penalty, more skeptical of immigration -- and their views of Muslims, interestingly, seemed to have been influenced by Trump's own rhetoric, becoming more hostile between 2016 and 2017.But in general, churchgoing Republicans look more like the party many elite conservatives wanted to believe existed before Trump came along -- more racially-tolerant, more accepting of multiculturalism and globalization, and also more consistently libertarian on economics. Secularized Trump voters look more like the party as Trump has tried to remake it, blending an inchoate economic populism with strong racial resentments.Interestingly in the survey the different groups make about the same amount of money, which cuts against strict economic-anxiety explanations for Trumpism. But the churchgoers and nonchurchgoers differ more in social capital: The irreligious are less likely to have college degrees, less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced; they're also less civically engaged, less satisfied with their neighborhoods and communities, and less trusting and optimistic in general.This seems to support the argument, advanced by Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner among others, that support for populism correlates with a kind of communal breakdown, in which secularization is one variable among many leaving people feeling isolated and angry, and drawing them to the ersatz solidarity of white identity politics.Meanwhile frequent church attenders, already a minority within the wider society, are also a minority within the Republican coalition. Relatively few Republicans are explicitly religiously unaffiliated (though that number has been climbing too), but only about a third of Trump's 2016 voters are in church on a typical Sunday, and almost half attend seldom or not at all.This suggests a possibility that should worry both Trump's religious supporters and anyone who finds his style of conservatism racially toxic. Despite their resistance to that toxicity, the churchgoers in this survey did vote for him, making a pragmatic bet that his policies on abortion and religious liberty were worth living with his Caligulan personal life and racial demagoguery.",Newspapers,2018,"person, group, ideology",['not secularized Trump voters']

When Obama became president, on the other hand, even with record popularity, the Republicans were uncompromising in their opposition.“The Democrats don’t need that level of political bravery to oppose Trump, and they will hear that from their constituents when they do anything that seems vaguely like cooperation,” he says.The Republicans believed they would repeal Obama’s healthcare legislation instantly – “like a band-aid” – and that the legislation would unify their own party and divide the Democrats. The opposite has happened. The Republicans cannot agree on what to repeal and what to keep, what to replace the existing coverage with – and thousands of Americans are protesting, not just to keep their healthcare provision, but because they could inflict Trump’s first defeat.As trade union leader David Rolf tells me, the only hope for the Democrats is “progressive economic populism – they have to stand up for what’s good for the majority of Americans even if it’s not good for the donor class of the Democrats”.There is no path to victory for the Democrats in reverting to pro-establishment centrism. That doesn’t mean abandoning attempts to build broad coalitions.

In a polarized political climate, secular stagnation will encourage America's economic elite to tilt further rightward in the coming decade, even though the Republican Party will continue to drift in a populist direction, supporting new barriers to international trade and migration. In the past, economic elites might have been comfortable with a market-friendly approach from left-leaning parties. In the future, that comfort will fade, because both the political space for a moderate left approach to governing and the economic growth generated by such an approach appear to be shrinking. Between accommodating economic populism from the left and nationalist populism from the right, plutocrats will opt for the latter. Populist nationalism will not generate greater economic growth, but it does lead to redistribution that favors owners of capital. Preliminary evidence for this redistribution can already be seen from the reactions of plutocrats to the Trump administration's first year in office.

But what’s been less noticed, even in Alaska, is the role played by millennials who, rather than spending years working their way up on the team, instead reinvented the playbook. Three men in particular—Kreiss-Tomkins, Forrest Dunbar and John-Henry Heckendorn—have pointed the way to reviving progressivism in the state by recruiting new, outsider candidates, teaching them how to win, and connecting them with fellow travelers. In bypassing traditional channels—which in Alaska, as everywhere else, tend to elevate predictable, uninspiring pols who have paid their dues—they’ve propelled a wave of untested candidates with little experience and even less party identity, but who believe in the economic populist agenda shared by a coalition of labor, environmentalists and the state’s large, politically engaged Alaska Native population.Their emerging coalition has been a boon for the Democratic Party, of course, but what’s remarkable is how little of this transformation has depended on the party. To the extent that the Democratic Party has helped in its own revival—and in transforming Alaska from deep red to a blue-ish purple—it was in part by getting out of the way. As progressives across the country try to pry Republicans out of power, they have important lessons to learn from a state where they are wrongly thought to have no power at all.***There’s a refrain you’ll hear as you report about Alaska politics, especially if you’re an outsider: “You have to meet Forrest.” Last May, after I’d spend a few days in Juneau, I’d heard this advice often enough that I hopped a plane to Anchorage to meet the mythical Forrest Dunbar.

Back in 2014, Stacey Abrams began an uphill crusade to convince Democrats that they could win the state by tapping into the growing numbers of unregistered young people and people of color with a slightly more progressive message.Few Democrats listened in the 2016 campaign. As Greg Bluestein writes in Flipped: How Georgia Turned Purple and Broke the Monopoly on Republican Power, Abrams and other local Georgia leaders practically “begged Hillary Clinton’s campaign to take the state seriously” in 2016, but their pleas fell on deaf ears.Four years later, nothing was the same.

2031092463,Postal banking is back on the table. Here's why that matters,4/27/2018,SourceMedia dba Arizent,"Whether you like the idea or hate it, expect to hear a lot more about postal banking over the next two and a half years.That’s because the concept of offering retail banking services at all 30,000 U.S. Postal Service locations will almost certainly be part of the Democratic Party’s economic agenda during the 2020 presidential campaign.The latest sign of what’s ahead came on Wednesday, when Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand unveiled new legislation to create a postal bank.Gillibrand, D-N.Y., frequently appears on lists of potential presidential candidates, and her endorsement of postal banking comes after two other would-be Democratic presidential contenders, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, staked out the same position.Add to the mix the fact that economic populism is ascendant in the Democratic Party, and it seems likely that postal banking will quickly congeal into party orthodoxy.Maybe it has already.While postal banking did not get much attention on the 2016 campaign trail, the proposal nonetheless made its way into the Democratic Party’s platform. Hillary Clinton, whose candidacy was hurt by her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, was undoubtedly a poor vessel for the idea.Clinton is highly unlikely to be on the ballot again in 2020, in part because the Democrats are trying to build a message that can appeal to white working-class voters who previously embraced Donald Trump’s brand of populism. Postal banking is an idea tailor-made for the political environment.Under Gillibrand’s proposal, the Post Office would offer not only low-cost small-dollar loans, but also remittance services and checking and savings accounts that would come with debit cards and online services.The deposit accounts could be as large as $20,000 per account, according to the legislative text. They might be offered by the Postal Service alone or in partnership with banks and credit unions.Gillibrand’s legislation embraces a far more expansive vision of postal banking than has ever been adopted in the United States.Between 1911 and 1967, the U.S.",Newspapers,2018,"person, policy, group",['Democrats']

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

Not after today.”Locked out of power in Washington, Democrats have struggled to settle on an economic message in the months since Trump’s inauguration. Schumer conceded that Trump’s message of economic populism resonated with voters in 2016, but argued that the president had failed to live up to his promise to be the “greatest jobs president that God ever created”.“When you lose elections as we did in 2014, 2016, you don’t flinch, you don’t blink. You look in the mirror and ask: what did we do wrong?” Schumer said. “The No 1 thing we did wrong is not present a strong, bold economic agenda to working Americans so that their hope for the future might return again.”The challenge for Democrats will be how to hone an economic message when an energized wing of the party is demanding complete opposition to an unpopular president.

2829930088,Democratic national convention: fight for America's soul moves on to Philadelphia,7/24/2016,Guardian News & Media Limited,"“It’s a raw political moment in our party.”Even Cruz’s supporters made clear that questioning Trump was no longer acceptable at the Republican convention.“I’m very angry at him not keeping his promise to back the eventual nominee,” said one Texas delegate sent to Cleveland to vote for Cruz.“We’ll remember this for a long time,” added another, from California.‘The rest of the country doesn’t hate Hillary like they do’Now, the focus of resistance shifts to another city. Similar tight security awaits in Philadelphia, where the Democratic party starts its convention on Monday, but the mood is likely to be very different. Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton will join an all-star lineup of Washington A-listers trying to deal with the threat from Trump.The ferocious attacks on Clinton might be uncomfortable to watch, but if anything they are the least of the party’s worries, serving to unify Democrats and alienate independents, according to political strategists.“Unfortunately for the rabid Republicans, the rest of the country doesn’t hate Hillary like they do,” said Katie Packer, a Washington consultant who was a deputy campaign manager for the GOP’s 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. “They don’t know that because they only watch Fox News and mostly interact with people who think like them.”Under this thesis, those Republicans holding their noses over Trump are deluding themselves in thinking a highly personalised campaign against Clinton will succeed in overcoming their own party negatives.“There are a lot of people who are falling in line and don’t feel comfortable with it and the only thing they reassure themselves with is, ‘Well, he’s better than Hillary,’ which is not a winning message,” Packer said.Moderates “aren’t excited by [Clinton] and they don’t really trust her”, she added, “but they don’t hate her, so the message that he is better than Hillary isn’t compelling enough to win elections.”According to Democratic strategists, a bigger dilemma is how to respond to Trump’s increasingly overt nationalism and economic populism.By whipping up fears not only of immigrants but also terrorists, criminals and anyone who protests against police brutality, the Republican nominee is potentially well-positioned in a world where all of these seem to be on the rise.Similarly, by staking out an aggressive stance against Wall Street and supposedly job-killing foreign trade deals, Trump could also outflank Clinton on the left, in a time of deep economic insecurity.Progressives in the Democratic party would like to see Clinton follow her primary rival Bernie Sanders down a similar road, but she signalled the opposite this weekend by appointing the centrist Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her vice-presidential running mate, rather than the more fiery Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.Since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans have a new opening to attack DemocratsStephanie Taylor, Progressive Change Campaign Committee“As we saw in Donald Trump’s speech last night, Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year,” said Stephanie Taylor, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, who believes the VP decision is a mistake.“Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue. The mood of the country is a populist one. The center of gravity in the Democratic party has shifted in a bold, populist, progressive direction – regardless of who is selected by Hillary Clinton as vice-president.”Many disaffected Republicans, meanwhile, believe demographic changes mean that millennial voters are also up for grabs in the centre of the political spectrum.“We might be watching the funeral of the Republican party at this convention,” said Richard Tafel, founder of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group that advocates for gay rights in a party still slowly coming around to the idea.“There is an opportunity for a new centre-right opening up,” he added.Another strategic question that Democrats will be grappling with in Philadelphia is how to deal with Trump’s authoritarian bombast.The initial temptation has been to take the celebrity billionaire at his word. Early campaign messaging by Clinton focused on what many saw as the devastating consequences of his promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants or ban Muslims from entering the US.But as Trump’s reputation for playing fast and loose with policy leads him toward ever more outlandish claims, some Clinton strategists are beginning to wonder whether taking him too seriously is a mistake.",Web Resources,2016,"group, ideology","['Progressive Change Campaign Committee', 'progressives']"

In one of the more recent entries in this debate, Ross Douthat has considered  the future of traditional fusionism on the right. Roughly speaking, this is the name given to the alliance of social conservatives, economic libertarians, and national security hawks that emerged during the Cold War and existed in some form, with its own set of tensions, until Trump came along. Throwing out some ideas about what a post-Trump version of this may look like, Douthat writes, ""the basic concept of a right rooted more in cultural conservatism and economic populism than in libertarianism and individualism isn’t fanciful; it describes the emergent right-of-center ideological formations all across the Western world.""
Douthat is not alone in suggesting that the limited government ideology that was a fixture on the right for decades could continue to recede in influence going forward.  
Trump's populist success within the GOP would provide empirical reasons to be skeptical of the future for the limited government branch of the conservative movement. After all, Trump has launched (or threatened) multiple trade wars, has resisted doing anything to address entitlement spending, and has managed to increase deficits during a booming economy.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

Democrat Hillary Clinton turned off some voters, while Trump's appeals to block illegal immigration and economic populism resonated with them.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

THE LEFT IN the United States has historically foundered over how to develop a political strategy that recognizes all the contradictions inherent in the Intersections of class and race. Early 20th century socialists, like Eugene Debs, believed that attacking the class system embedded in capitalism would, in itself, solve the ""Negro Question.""
On the other hand, the Communist Party USA during its ""Third Period"" in the late 1920s and early 1930s, raised the slogan of ""Self-Determination for the Black Belt,"" not with regard to the actual wishes of African Americans (North or South) but in obeisance to the doctrine of the Communist International that dictated a nationalist line. Ian Haney Lopez, a University of California-Berkeley law professor and author of Dog Whistle Politics (2014), in his important new book, Merge Left: Fusing Race and Class, Winning Elections, and Saving America, tries to navigate between a ""class"" left that continues to subordinate issues of racial justice under a banner of ""economic populism,"" evident at times in the Bernie Sanders campaign (141-45), and racial justice radicals who dismiss class as a determining factor in addressing the persistence of white supremacy. (98-116)
Acknowledging the со-determining role of class and race, Haney Lopez proposes a race-class approach that he believes will engender racial and economic justice. There is much to admire and emulate in Haney's analysis and strategy. At the same time, in his efforts to formulate a political strategy that goes beyond what he sees as the underlying ""moral"" arguments of racial justice advocates and downplaying of racism by the class left, Haney Lopez's positions become problematic precisely to the extent that they focus almost exclusively on electoral politics and the reliance on a ""winning"" rhetorical message.",Magazines,2020,"ideology, group",['not class left']

After Hillary Clinton's devastating loss nearly six months ago, her most powerful Democratic allies feared losing control of the party. Efforts to lip-synch economic populism while remaining closely tied to Wall Street had led to a catastrophic defeat. In the aftermath, the party's progressive base -- personified by Bernie Sanders -- was in position to start flipping over the corporate game board.

But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party's near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment.

May 18: ECONOMIST(THE) Bayer wants legislative help to fight its cancer lawsuits

For all the partisan rancour in American politics, the Trump era has produced some surprising convergences between left and right. Republican isolationists and left-wing Democrats often share a scepticism of American military might. And economic populists on the left and right can agree on resisting reform of entitlements such as Social Security or supporting aggressive antitrust action. This dynamic has spread to the states too. Consider Missouri, where trial lawyers (traditionally big supporters of Democrats) recently worked with a hard-right group to stop a change to tort laws.

1936135502,The Struggle Between Clinton and Sanders Is Not Over,9/7/2017,New York Times Company,"Brian Schaffner , a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, calculated that Sanders-to-Trump voters were key to Trump’s victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The accompanying chart, which is based on the 2016 survey conducted by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study , shows how crucial these voters were. The internal battle over how to maximize the political strength of the party reflects the fact that it is made up of a coalition of multiple , sometimes overlapping, factions with an intense desire to win, but in constant competition with one another. These factions include economic populists, led by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown; increasingly influential women , including Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Warren; an equally influential group of African-American politicians, including Cory Booker, Deval Patrick and Harris; Hispanics determined to gain power, including Julián and Joaquín Castro and Xavier Becerra; and a still strong but often challenged white male Democratic establishment that includes Joe Biden and Terry McAuliffe. Many of the current conflicts enlarge upon the ideological divisions that dominated the 2016 presidential primaries, with Hillary Clinton representing the centrist wing and Bernie Sanders the progressive wing. The debate going into the next election cycle raises the question of whether the Democratic Party will be most successful with continued — or enlarged — support from a segment of the white working class: 34 percent of non-college white women and 23 percent of non-college white men voted for Clinton in 2016.

In the years before Donald Trump, there were few groups that walked the line between beltway conservative politics and the far right. One such group is Students for Liberty, a libertarian student group that has slid toward the Alt Right since Trump's candidacy and is currently organizing a national conference to discuss the subject of anarchism and its potential for facilitating a left-right convergence.

In the survey, three-quarters of rural respondents agreed with this message, which appealed not just to liberal voters (who made up only 23 percent of the respondents), but also to the 42 percent who were conservatives and the 26 percent who were moderates. Critical race scholar Ian Haney López calls this kind of messaging the race-class narrative, and he argues that it is critical to reaching the 59 percent of American voters he calls the “persuadables.” López, along with messaging consultant Anat Shenker-Osorio and pollster Celinda Lake, document that race-class messaging is more convincing among persuadables than “colorblind economic populism”—that is, messaging that invokes class alone. Crucially for Democrats, these scholars have found that white, Black and Latino persuadable voters all find race-class narratives more convincing than color-blind populism, by similar margins.We can expect a significant subset of Trump voters to be receptive to a race-class message. A 2017 study by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group found that about one-fifth of Trump voters have bipartisan voting habits and warm feelings toward racial minorities. The study calls these voters “anti-elites,” and they present a major opportunity for Democrats: 83 percent of them think the economic system is biased in favor of the wealthiest Americans, and 68 percent of them favor raising taxes on the rich.Democrats often get tarred as the party of elites because their positions in the culture wars clash with those of blue-collar Americans, especially whites and Latinos, who tend to place a high value on self-discipline and the traditional institutions that anchor it, notably religion, the military and “family values.” Republican politicians naturally want to keep attention focused there.",Web Resources,2020,"ideology, group","['Rural Organizing', 'anti-elites']"

Seventy years on, many Republicans have failed to understand the message. How else could you explain Senator Rick Scott and the members of the Republican Study Committee, who keep pushing proposals to cut or privatise Social Security in direct opposition to the wishes of Republican voters? There are two answers to this question. The first involves the ideological disconnect between the Republican party’s increasingly multiracial non-college educated working-class voter base, whose members tend to be culturally conservative but economically populist and in favour of New Deal entitlements, and the wealthy college-educated libertarians who are the dominant force among the party’s donors, policy experts and journalists. The free-market radicals of donor-funded “Conservatism, Inc” despise Social Security precisely because it is a government program that is both efficient in minimising old-age poverty and popular across party lines. Crass financial self-interest on the part of some Republican donors is a factor as well.

Rocha pointed at John Fetterman’s wide-margin victory among Latinos as proof. NBC exit poll data shows 68 percent of Latinos in Pennsylvania voting for Fetterman — an eight-point overperformance compared to the national average — while a voter survey from African American Research Collaborative shows Fetterman having a 44-point lead among Hispanic voters.

Democrats’ recent success on Capitol Hill could significantly aid their efforts to challenge Republicans’ populist reputation.

195825181,Obama and the State of Democrats,3/1/2010,"Institute for Public Affairs, Inc.","But if he's looking for a way to save and create American jobs, that's one fertile area. 

Fortunately for Obama, the critical swing voters, while often conservative on other issues, are considerably more inclined to believe that the Democratic Party- rather than the GOP- is on their side when it comes to caring about their economic well-being ... and standing up to the big insurance companies, the big drug companies and the big banks. 

This is the Democrats' economic populist strength. It is a strength that Obama inherits. 

But Americans must start finding jobs in substantial numbers by summer, or this Democratic political legacy - along with the President's highly skillful presentations - will be for naught. Progressive Democrats must press the White House to continue the course it has appeared to embark on following the State of the Union- understanding fully that a dramatically expanded economic-recovery and jobs program will trigger a shrill Republican outcry and the deficit will indeed go up - but so will Obama's numbers.",Magazines,2010,"person, ideology, group","['Democrats', 'Progressive Democrats']"

1702838697,THE NATION; Clinton offers plan to cut student debt,8/11/2015,Los Angeles Times Communications LLC,"Clinton also would reduce the interest rate the government charges for Stafford loans so the program would break even, rather than generate a profit to the Treasury. Students could refinance outstanding loans at current lower rates, and future graduates would be eligible for an income-based repayment program, capping debt payments at 10% of their income. The campaign says the total cost of Clinton's proposal would be $350 billion over 10 years, and would be covered by closing tax loopholes on higher earners. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which promotes liberal policies, called the plan ""very big and ambitious"" and a sign of a ""rising economic populist tide in American politics."" Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank that has been a target of groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, also praised the plan while saying that it ""opens up a whole new conversation on the Democratic side of the aisle"": whether degrees are worth the cost. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute whom the campaign consulted, said there was reason to be optimistic that some elements of the plan could be adopted, either in a new Higher Education Act reauthorization underway in Congress or through separate legislation. Baum cited a number of factors that have led to the explosion of student debt, starting with the severity of the Great Recession and the rise of for-profit colleges.

2130044287,WSJ BLOG/Washington Wire: Politics Counts: What N.H. Can Tell Us About Romney's Chances,1/6/2012,Dow Jones & Company Inc.,"If he doesn't do better on Tuesday, it may show that the urban-rural divide we saw in Iowa's results is hardening. 

The Service Worker Centers are more rural in their character than other county types, but they aren't quite as culturally conservative as places like the Evangelical Epicenters. That's particularly true in a state like New Hampshire. 

If Mr. Romney can't do better in New Hampshire's Service Worker counties, it may suggest that his problem with some GOP primary voters isn't just his social conservative credentials but also his ability to reach economic populists. The Service Worker counties, with lower incomes and higher unemployment rates, have been hit especially hard in the recession. 

In the short-term fight of the nominating process, that might not stop Mr. Romney from winning the day. But considering the growing populist sentiment in the country -- evidenced in the Tea Party and Occupy movements -- it could hurt him in a general election fight.",Newspapers,2012,"ideology, group","['Tea Party', 'Occupy']"

About 14.6 million workers belonged to unions last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a 240,000-member drop from 2015.Though union ranks are shrinking, acceptance among conservatives seems to be rising, per the Gallup survey, which polled 1,000 people nationwide from  Aug. 2 to  6.Forty-two percent of Republicans said they approved of unions, a jump from 2011, when only 26 percent of Republicans showed support.Among Democrats, 81 percent of Democrats approved of unions, compared to 78 percent in 2011. Support among Independents has also climbed, reaching 61 percent from 52 percent six years ago.Joseph Slater, a law professor who follows labor issues at the University of Toledo College of Law, said one reason for the shift could be that more blue-collar workers have sided with the GOP since the 2016 campaign.""President Donald Trump ran as an economic populist and he was not himself anti-union,"" Slater said. Trump speaks often of boosting factory workers. He managed to flip counties across the Rust Belt - notably in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan - which felt disproportionate job loss as plants have shuttered, thanks to automation and foreign competition.Trump also continues to slam NAFTA, a move that could have come out of the AFL-CIO's playbook.
